<h2>Prologue</h2>
<h3>1</h3>
<p>This was in July 1916.</p>
<p>The woman sat alone in the room downstairs, stitching, stitching, by the flickering light of a small oil-lamp that stood on a ricketty deal table close beside her. By the side of the lamp there were some half-dozen khaki tunics, and the woman took up these tunics one by one, looked them over and patted them and turned them about and about: then she took up the scissors and undid a portion of the lining. After which she stitched that portion of the lining up again, but not before she had inserted something—something that was small and white and crisp and that she took out from a fold in the bosom of her dress—between the lining and the cloth.</p>
<p>And this she did to each of the half dozen tunics in turn.</p>
<p>The room was small and bare, the paper hung down from the walls in strips, but it happened to have a ceiling that had only partially fallen in during the last bombardment, and so it might be termed a luxurious room, seeing that there were very few ceilings left in Guillaumet now. There was no roof to the house, and not a pane of glass anywhere, but as it was very hot this July, this was really an advantage. Quite a pleasant draught stirred the tattered curtain that masked the broken window and fanned the woman's dark, unruly hair about her damp forehead.</p>
<p>She sat in ragged bodice and petticoat, her sleeves tucked up above her elbows, her bodice open, showing throat and breasts that were not unshapely.</p>
<p>"You are kind to those English fellows, Alice," a dry, sarcastic voice said suddenly, close behind her.</p>
<p>The woman gave a start, and the hand that patted and folded the last of the tunics shook ever so slightly. Her pale, wan face looked almost ashen in hue in the dim light of the lamp. She turned and looked at the newcomer, a tall, lean fellow with touzled dark hair and unshaven chin, who lolled under the lintel of the door, chewing the stump of a cigar and gazing at her with a kind of indulgently sarcastic expression in his deep-set eyes. At sight of him she seemed reassured. It was only Lucien—Lucien the vagrant, the picker-up of unconsidered trifles, attached as porter to one of the American hospitals somewhere close by. So everybody round about here understood. But no one ever inquired further than that; everyone was too busy to trouble about other people's affairs; and Lucien was useful and willing. Though he had a game leg he would do anything he was asked—run errands, repair a derelict car, clean boots, anything. Lucien l'Américain they called him. "The Yank" the English flying boys from the aerodrome at Guillaumet had nicknamed him.</p>
<p>And they rather liked the Yank. Though he was as ugly as sin, swarthy, most days unshaved and dirty, he was very amusing, had a fund of good stories to relate, and was always ready for a gamble or a bit of fun. He seemed plentifully supplied with money, too—tips, probably, which he collected from the French or English officers over at the hospital—and was very free with it in the way of drinks and cigarettes for the boys. Latterly his open courtship of Alice Gerbier had caused considerable amusement in Guillaumet. Alice was a good sort, of course, but so jolly ugly, and not so young as she once was. It was difficult to imagine any man wanting to make love to Alice Gerbier. But Lucien l'Américain must have done it after a fashion of his own, before Alice became his abject slave, fetching and carrying for him, working her fingers to the bone, and sitting up half the night sewing shirts and knitting socks for him. He took it all as a matter of course, and treated her as if she were so much dirt.</p>
<p>"The only way to treat women," he would remark cynically, whenever his harshness toward poor Alice roused the indignation of one of the men.</p>
<p>It was a curious courtship, and the boys who were quartered in old mother Gerbier's house often wondered how it would end. Poor Alice! It was her one chance. If she lost this undemonstrative admirer of hers she would never get another. No doubt she felt that, poor thing, for at times her eyes would look pathetically wistful, when she caught sight of Lucien making himself agreeable to other women.</p>
<p>Lucien l'Américain lolled into the room and came to a halt close beside Alice's chair; with the air of a condescending pasha he patted her thin shoulders.</p>
<p>"You are kinder to these fellows," he said, "than you are to me. Why the dickens you should work so hard for them I don't know. You look dog-tired, and it's swelteringly hot to-night. We shall have a storm, I think."</p>
<p>"The boys were saying they thought a storm was coming on," Alice said in a tired, toneless voice, "and they were hoping it would soon be over."</p>
<p>"Off as usual in the morning, I suppose," Lucien remarked curtly.</p>
<p>The woman nodded.</p>
<p>"And like a good soul you are putting a few stitches to their clothes, eh?" the man went on, and jerked a grimy thumb in the direction of the pile of tunics.</p>
<p>"There's no one else to do it for them," the woman rejoined in the same toneless, listless voice.</p>
<p>"Rather a futile task," he rejoined drily. "What is a hole more or less in a tunic? How many of these fellows will come back from their raid tomorrow do you suppose? Most of these carefully mended tunics will supplement the meagre wardrobes of our friend Fritz over the way, I'm thinking."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," the woman assented with a weary sigh.</p>
<p>“How many of them are going to-morrow?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I don't know. All the men in this house are going.”</p>
<p>"And how many will come back do you think?"</p>
<p>The woman shuddered and pressed her thin, colourless lips more tightly together. The Yank gave a harsh laugh and shrugged his lean shoulders.</p>
<p>"These English flying men are very daring,” he said lightly; "even Fritz will admit that much. They'll take the maddest risks! I don't think that you will see many of these tunics back here at close of day to-morrow.”</p>
<p>The woman, however, remained obstinately silent. Whilst Lucien threw himself into a broken-down armchair that groaned under his weight, she rose and gathered up the pile of tunics.</p>
<p>"What are you doing with the things ?” he asked querulously. “Can't you sit still for once and talk to me?"</p>
<p>He stretched out a long, muscular arm, succeeded in grabbing her dress, and drew her with sudden violence towards him. She tried to resist and to clutch the tunics tightly against her breast, but they fell out of her arms in a heap on the floor. She would have stooped to pick them up, but in a moment Lucien had her by the shoulders, forcing her to turn and to look at him.</p>
<p>"You are kinder to those fellows," he reiterated with his harsh laugh, “than you are to me. Leave those things alone, I say, and get me something to drink. What have you got in the house?"</p>
<p>But Alice for once was obstinate. As a rule even an unspoken wish from Lucien was a law unto her, but this time she wrenched herself free from his grasp, and getting down on one knee she started picking up the tunics from the floor. Lucien watched her for a moment or two through half-closed lids, with an undefinable expression on his lean, swarthy face, and a strange line, almost of cruelty, around his firm lips. Apparently he was not accustomed to seeing his whims thwarted, and no doubt he was impelled by the very human desire to probe his power upon this fond and foolish woman, for suddenly he jumped up, gave the tunics that were still on the floor a vigorous kick which sent them flying to the farthest corner of the room, and roughly grabbed the others which Alice was hugging to her breast.</p>
<p>"I told you," he said with a savage oath, "to leave those things alone and to get me a drink."</p>
<p>For the space of a few seconds, Alice still hesitated; she looked up at him with a pathetic expression of wistfulness and subjection, while she wiped the palms of her moist hands against her tattered apron. Lucien's eyes, meeting hers, lost their savage gleam; he looked almost ashamed of his brutality.</p>
<p>"That's all right, my girl," he said with an indulgent smile. "I didn't mean to be unkind. Get me a drink, there's a good soul. Where did you want to put these things?" he added, as he condescended to stoop and collect the scattered tunics.</p>
<p>Alice's wan face at once beamed with a joy as pathetic as her anxiety had been just now. She even contrived to smile.</p>
<p>"Never mind about them, Lucien," she said, and with rather jerky movements she wiped the top of the table with her apron. Then she turned towards the door: "I'll put the things away presently. I can get you a bottle of that wine you brought in the other day. Would you like that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I should," the Yank rejoined. "And then you can come and sit still for a bit. That eternal stitch-stitching of yours gets on my nerves. Now," he went on, and, having collected all the tunics, he placed them back upon the table, "why you wanted to fiddle with these tunics I can't imagine. They can't have needed mending. Why, they are practically new."</p>
<p>He turned them over one by one: they were as he said, almost new—beautiful khaki tunics, smart and well-cut, such as the British government loved to serve out to its magnificent airmen. Then, as Alice had suddenly come to a halt by the door, he half-turned to her, and added in his usual harsh, peremptory tone:</p>
<p>"Are you getting me that wine or are you not?"</p>
<p>For a few seconds after Alice had finally left the room Lucien l'Américain remained standing by the table, his grimy hand upon the pile of tunics, motionless, his eyes fixed upon the narrow doorway through which Alice had disappeared, his ear bent, listening to her retreating footsteps. As soon as these had died away down the stone steps which led to the cellar his whole attitude changed. He threw the stump of his cigar away and, picking up one of the tunics, he felt it all over scrupulously—all over, and with both hands, until in one spot his sensitive fingers felt something that had a slightly crackling, crisp sound about it when handled.</p>
<p>Whereupon Lucien l'Américain drew a deep breath, and in his deep-set eyes there came a quick flash of triumph. One by one, more quickly now and more surely he picked up the tunics and felt each one in turn all over until his fingers encountered the something crisp and crackling which appeared hidden between the cloth and the lining, and while he did so his face, never prepossessing, looked positively hideous; a cruel, almost animal look distorted it, the lips drew back against the gums, showing white teeth, sharp and gleaming like those of a wolf.</p>
<p>"That's it, is it?" he muttered once or twice. "Not bad for a woman. Did she think of it, I wonder."</p>
<p>Suddenly his sharp ears detected the sound of Alice's tired footstep coming up the cellar stairs. He laid the tunics back upon the table in a neat pile, then he went to the window, drew the curtain slightly aside and gave a low, prolonged whistle, which was almost immediately answered by another from somewhere out in the darkness.</p>
<p>Alice came in, carrying a bottle of wine and a mug. There was a scared look in her eyes as she entered, and her glance swept quickly, anxiously round the room first and then over the pile of tunics. Seeing them neatly folded, she appeared relieved, and set the bottle and mug down upon the table. She took a corkscrew from the table-drawer and proceeded to draw the cork, whilst Lucien watched her with a smile round his lips which the girl hardly dared to interpret. Now he lolled across to her. His hands were in his pockets.</p>
<p>She had succeeded in drawing the cork, and was pouring the wine into the mug, when with a swift movement Lucien's arm shot out and closed round her throat, whilst his other hand was clapped firmly against her mouth. She had not the time to scream. The bottle of wine fell out of her hand, crashing on the floor and the wine flowed in a stream along the cracks of the worm-eaten wood in the direction of the door. Her eyes, dilated with horror, stared into vacancy, her hands with fingers outspread were stretched out straight before her. Lucien l'Américain never uttered a word; he just held her in a grip of iron, smothering any attempt she might make to scream. Less than twenty seconds went by whilst he held the woman thus, and she passed from an excess of horror into semi-consciousness. Then from the outer passage there came the sound of stealthy footsteps, and the next moment two men dressed in rough peasant clothes came into the room. Lucien l'Américain motioned to them with a glance, and silently, almost noiselessly, they closed in around the woman and in a moment had her secure between them and marched her out of the room, she going like a sleepwalker with eyes closed and lips tightly pressed together, her face a reflex of the horror which had invaded her soul.</p>
<p>Lucien l'Américain, left alone in the room, took up one of the tunics and with Alice's scissors he carefully undid a few stitches in the lining. His deft fingers then groped in the aperture, until they came in contact with something crisp and crackling, which he drew out and examined. It was a small sheet of thin paper closely covered with minute handwriting, and then folded into as small a compass as had been possible. By the flickering light of the oil-lamp the Yank tried to decipher some of the writing; his face had become expressionless as marble. It seemed as if with the unmasking of the woman, his interest in the event had ceased.</p>
<p>The paper contained information which would have been of enormous importance to the Germans. Having skimmed the written matter through, Lucien folded up the paper again and slipped it in a pocketbook, which he carried next to his skin. After that he took up the tunics one by one, and still with the aid of Alice's scissors he extracted the same message which was concealed in the selfsame way between the lining and the cloth of each tunic, and these also he put away in his pocket-book.</p>
<p>He had only just finished his task when from down the village street there rose the joyful sound of lusty throats singing "Tipperary!" and a minute or two later half a dozen boys in khaki made noisy irruption into the house.</p>
<p>At once there was loud shouting of "Alice! Alice, where art thou? What ho, my Alice!" And one of the boys started singing "The Roses of Picardy."</p>
<p>"Hallo, Yankl" came from another of them, who had just caught sight of Lucien. "What the ⸻ have you done with Alice?"</p>
<p>"She'll be back directly," Lucien shouted in response. "I've promised to meet her, so can't stop. S'long!"</p>
<p>He dashed out of the house, and in a moment the darkness had swallowed him up.</p>
<h3>2</h3>
<p>Three days later. Half an hour after the break of dawn. In a moderately well-furnished room in the town hall of Lille an elderly man was sitting over a scanty petit-déjeuner. He had an intellectual face, with high-bred features and sparse grey hair carefully brushed across his cranium so as to hide the beginnings of baldness. From time to time he cast eager eyes at the door opposite to where he was sitting or anxious ones at the clock upon the mantelshelf.</p>
<p>Suddenly his whole face brightened up with eager expectancy. He had just perceived the sound of a harsh voice coming from the next room, and demanding peremptorily to speak with M. de Kervoisin.</p>
<p>A servant entered, but de Kervoisin was too impatient to allow him to speak.</p>
<p>"Number Ten is it?" he queried sharply, and at once added, "Show him in."</p>
<p>A tall, ragged, uncouth, unshaved creature sauntered into the room, with hands in pockets and a chawed cigar stump in the corner of his mouth. Strangely enough the elegant high-bred M. de Kervoisin received this extraordinary visitor with the utmost courtesy. He rose to greet him, shook him warmly by the hand, offered him a chair, coffee, liqueurs, cigarettes. The newcomer declined everything except the armchair, into which he threw himself with obvious satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Tired, my friend?" M. de Kervoisin queried amiably.</p>
<p>"Of course," the other replied curtly. "I have been up nearly two hours."</p>
<p>"The want of sleep," M. de Kervoisin murmured with an engaging smile. Then he added drily: "And I suppose some emotion ..."</p>
<p>"Emotion?" the other broke in with a harsh laugh. "None, I assure you, save what is pleasurable."</p>
<p>"What? To see a woman shot?"</p>
<p>He who went by the strange appellation of Number Ten threw aside the chawed stump of his cigar, then he carefully selected a cigarette from M. de Kervoisin's case, and lit it leisurely before he replied:</p>
<p>"Yes, my friend ... to see a woman shot. Have you never seen a human creature shot or hung?"</p>
<p>"No, never!" M. de Kervoisin replied with a shudder. "And I hope I never may."</p>
<p>"It is a thrill well worth experiencing," the other remarked and blew rings of cigarette smoke through his pursed lips. "Yes," he went on drily, "well worth experiencing."</p>
<p>"Ah!" M. de Kervoisin rejoined with a sigh, "you English are astonishing."</p>
<p>"Yes, I dare say we seem so to you," Number Ten retorted. "But we do not shoot women."</p>
<p>"So I understand. The danger of spies is not quite so acute with you as it is with us; and this woman was really dangerous."</p>
<p>"She was dangerous because she was so extraordinarily clever. In all my experience I never came across anything quite so ingenious as the way she went to work."</p>
<p>"She worked from the British aerodrome, I think you told me, behind Guillaumet?"</p>
<p>"And calculated that out of every half-dozen English machines that went up, at least three would come down behind the German lines: so she inserted all the information she could get in the linings of the airmen's tunics. A clever idea," Number Ten added thoughtfully, "and in the end I only discovered the trick by accident."</p>
<p>He smiled, and stared for a second straight out before him, and as he did so memory brought back vividly the picture of the tumble-down house at Guillaumet, and Alice Gerbier sitting there, stitching, stitching with the pile of tunics before her, and he himself—disguised as a loafer, commonly called Lucien l'Américain, for no particular reason, as he certainly was not American—hanging round the woman for weeks, vaguely suspecting at first, then certain, then wondering how the trick was done, the clever trick whereby so much valuable information was conveyed to the Germans, information that could only have been obtained in the neighbourhood of the English aerodrome. And he saw himself, the spy-tracker, the secret-service agent, carefully setting the trap which had ensnared so many women ever since the world began, the trap set with a bait to lure a woman's vanity, and an old maid's passionate longing for love. And to these memory pictures another now was added, the picture of Alice Gerbier in the early dawn in the prison yard of Lille, with her back to the wall, and a handkerchief over her eyes, and a platoon of soldiers with rifles raised. And gradually as these pictures passed before his mind's eye, became strangely vivid and then passed by again, the man's expressive face became hideous in its aspect of ruthless cruelty. The eyes narrowed till they were mere slits, the lips curled up over the gums displaying a row of teeth pointed and sharp as those of a wolf.</p>
<p>A discreet cough from M. de Kervoisin roused him from his meditation.</p>
<p>"You are certainly a prince amongst secret service agents, my friend," M. de Kervoisin said suavely. "I don't know what we should do without you. But Alice Gerbier certainly represents your crowning triumph."</p>
<p>Number Ten gave a harsh laugh.</p>
<p>"It certainly was a thrill," he said coolly, "well worth experiencing."</p>


<h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>

<p>To Peter Blakeney, Rosemary Fowkes' engagement to his friend
Tarkington seemed not only incredible but impossible. The end of
the world! Death! Annihilation! Hell! Anything!</p>

<p>But it could not be true.</p>

<p>He was playing at Lord's that day; Tarkington told him the news
at the luncheon interval, and Peter had thought for the moment that
for once in his life Tarkington must be drunk. But Tarkington
looked just as he always did—grave, impassive, and
wonderfully kind. Indeed, he seemed specially kind just then.
Perhaps he knew. Perhaps Rosemary had told him. Women were so
queer. Perhaps she did tell Tarkington that he, Peter, had once
been fool enough to—</p>

<p>Anyway, Tarkington was sober, and very grave and kind, and he
told Peter in his quiet, unemotional way that he considered himself
the happiest man on God's earth. Of course he was, if
Rosemary—But it was impossible. Impossible!
<i>Impossible!!</i></p>

<p>That afternoon Peter hit many boundaries, and at the end of play
was 148 not out.</p>

<p>In the evening he went to the Five Arts' Ball at the Albert
Hall. He knew that Rosemary would be there; he had designed the
dress she would be wearing, and Tarkington told him, sometime
during that afternoon that he was taking his fiancée to the
ball.</p>

<p>His fiancée! Dear old Tarkington! So kind, so unemotional!
Rosemary's husband presently! Ye gods!</p>

<p>At the Albert Hall ball Peter wore that beautiful Hungarian
national dress that had belonged to his grandfather, a wonderful
dress of semi-barbaric splendour, with the priceless
fifteenth-century jewellery which he had inherited from his
mother—the buttons, the sword-belt, the clasp for the
mantle—they had been in the Heves family ever since it was
fashioned by Florentine workmen imported into Hungary by a medieval
queen. Peter dressed himself with the greatest care. If a thing was
worth doing at all, it was worth doing well, and Rosemary had said
once that she would like to see him in the dress.</p>

<p>But during that hot afternoon at Lord's while he dressed, and
now inside the crowded, stuffy Albert Hall, Peter did not feel as
if he were really alive. He did not feel like a personage in a
dream, he only felt that the world as he had seen it since luncheon
time, was not a real world. Someone had invented something
altogether new in opposition to the Creator, and he, Peter, being
no longer alive, was permitted a private view of the novelty.</p>

<p>It appeared to be a very successful novelty. At any rate, the
numberless puppets who raised shrill voices so that Peter might
hear what they said, all declared that this ball was incontestably
the most successful function of the season.</p>

<p>Just as in the real world, Peter thought, where every function
is always incontestably the most successful function of the
season.</p>

<p>Other shrill voices declared in Peter's hearing that this
function had been more than usually well-managed. It had been
splendidly advertised, and the tickets had sold like the proverbial
hot cakes.</p>

<p>And Peter was quite sure that somewhere in the dead, forgotten
world of long ago he had heard such an expression of opinion over
and over again.</p>

<p>Anyway, in this Albert Hall of the newly invented world things
were much as they had been in the old. It was crowded. At one time
there was hardly room enough to move, let alone to dance. Certain
contortions of the body being called dancing, now as then, and
certain demoniacal sounds made on hellish instruments by gentlemen
of colour being called dance music, the floor of the hall, raised
to the level of the lower-tier boxes, was given over to the
performance of various gyrations more or less graceful, whilst
Peter looked on, strangely familiar with this new world of
unrealities which had only been invented a few hours ago, when
Tarkington told him of his engagement to Rosemary Fowkes.</p>

<p>He knew just how it would be!</p>

<p>In to-morrow's issue of the <i>Morning Star</i> or the <i>Talk
of the Town</i>, the thousands who gyrated here or who looked on at
the gyrations of others would be referred to as being "also
present."</p>

<p>He, Peter Blakeney, the famous cricketer and distinguished V.C.,
would be referred to as being "also present," and there would be a
photograph of him with a set grin on his face and his eyes staring
out of his head like those of a lunatic at large, in all the
illustrated weeklies. This was as it should be. It was well worth
paying two guineas (supper included) for the privilege of being
referred to as "also present" in this distinguished company of
puppets that included both home and foreign royalties.</p>

<p>Of course there were others, the select few who would be
referred to in the columns of the <i>Morning Star</i> or the
<i>Talk of the Town</i> with charming familiarity as Lord Algy
Fitznoodle, or Miss Baby Tomkins, or simply as Lady Poots or Lord
Tim.</p>

<p>"While I was chatting with Lady Poots, etc."</p>

<p>"Lady Vi Dartmouth, with her beautiful hair shingled, etc.
etc."</p>

<p>"The Marchioness of Flint came with her girls, etc."</p>

<p>All of which Peter knew by intuition would be vastly interesting
to the suburban little madams who read <i>Talk of the Town</i> in
this world of unrealities, that the puppets named Miss Baby or Lady
Vi, would not think of being absent from the Five Arts' Ball. It
was the acme of smartness, of Bohemian smartness, that is to say:
the smartness of Chelsea and fashionable studios, which is so much
smarter than the smartness of Mayfair.</p>

<p>And Peter—a kind of disembodied Peter—watched the
throng. Ye gods! what a motley and a medley!</p>

<p>Polychromatic and kaleidoscopic, iridescent and prismatic,
ceaselessly on the move, mercurial, restless, ever stirring,
fluttering fans, fingering clothes, adjusting coiffures, lapels,
frills, hair-ornaments and feathers! And talking! Talking
incessantly, with voices hard and high-pitched trying to rise above
other voices that were harder and higher of pitch. Dazzling to eye
and ear; exciting to nerves and sense, the atmosphere and mixture
of odours: of powders, cosmetics, perfumes, heat, gas, and a score
of other indefinable scents.</p>

<p>The picture quite brilliant; not without touches of unconscious
humour: Marie Antoinette flirting with Robespierre, Russian moujik
in familiar converse with a jewelled Catherine, Queen Elizabeth
condescending to pre-historic man. And then Pierrots, Pierrots
everywhere, of every conceivable motley and shape. Blue Pierrots
and yellow Pierrots! white or black, purple with orange frills, and
orange with purple frills, black skull caps and tall white peaks.
Pierrots of satin, and Pierrots of gingham! Cool and active! Ye
gods! how active! Bohemian smartness, it seems, demanded that its
Pierrots should be bright and amusing and active.</p>

<p>From his point of vantage on the floor of the hall Peter scanned
the semicircle of boxes where sat more puppets, hundreds of them,
watching the thousands down below.</p>

<p>What was the good of them? Peter thought. Why has God made them?
What use were they in his new world which some wanton sprite had
fashioned in opposition to the Creator? They fluttered their fans,
they laughed, they jabbered, and did not seem to know that they,
just like Peter, had become unreal and disembodied at the precise
moment when Rosemary Fowkes promised to become Jasper Tarkington's
wife.</p>

<p>And then suddenly the puppets all faded away. The new world
ceased to be, there was no hall, no dancing, no music, no more
puppets, no more Pierrots. There was only Rosemary, and she came up
to Peter and said quite gaily, naturally, in a voice that belonged
to the old world, not the new:</p>

<p>"Won't you ask me to dance, Peter?"</p>

<p>After that—well, dancing permits, necessitates, holding
the partner in one's arms. And Peter danced with Rosemary.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 2</h2>

<p>Lady Orange always had a box for the big functions at the Albert
Hall. It was chic, it was right and it was convenient. It gave her
an opportunity of entertaining distinguished foreigners de passage
in London in a manner that was both original and expensive.</p>

<p>Lady Orange prided herself on her internationalism, and
delighted to gather distinguished foreigners about her; members and
attaches of minor embassies invariable graced her dinner parties.
She often referred to her attainments as "bi-lingual," and in
effect she spoke French with a perfect Geneva accent. She thought
it bon ton to appear bored at every social function except those
which took place at her house in Belgrave Square, and now when a
procession made up of bedizened unities marched in double file past
her box she remarked languidly:</p>

<p>"I think they show a singular lack of imagination. One would
have thought Chelsea artists would have invented something unique,
picturesque for themselves."</p>

<p>"They only thought of comfort, perhaps. But it is they who gave
the impetus to the imagination of others. Not?"</p>

<p>The man who sat next to Lady Orange spoke with certain gestures
of hands and arms that would have proclaimed him a foreigner ever
apart from his appearance—the somewhat wide expanse of white
waistcoat, the ultra-smart cut of his evening clothes, the diamond
ring on his finger. He had large, mellow dark eyes, which he used
with great effect when he spoke to women, and full lips
half-concealed under a heavy black moustache. He had a soft, rich
voice, and spoke English with that peculiar intonation which is
neither Italian nor Slav, but has the somewhat unpleasant
characteristics of both; and he had large, well-shaped, podgy hands
all covered with a soft dark down that extended almost to his
finger-tips.</p>

<p>Lady Orange, who had pale, round eyes and arched eyebrows that
lent to her face a perpetual look of surprise, gazed intelligently
about her.</p>

<p>"<i>Ah, oui</i>!" she sighed vaguely. "<i>Vous avez
raison!</i>"</p>

<p>She would have liked to continue the conversation in French, but
General Naniescu was equally determined to speak English.</p>

<p>As Lady Orange was going to Bucharest shortly, and desired an
introduction to august personages there, she thought it best to
humour the general's whim.</p>

<p>"How well you express yourself in our barbarous tongue, M. le
General!" she said kindly.</p>

<p>"Ah, madame," the general replied, with an expressive shrug, "we
in our country are at such disadvantage in the social life of great
cities like London and Paris, that we must strive to win our way by
mastering the intricacies of language, so as to enable us to
converse freely with the intelligentsia of the West who honour us
by their gracious acceptance."</p>

<p>"You are a born courtier, Monsieur le General," Lady Orange
rejoined with a gracious smile. "Is he not, <i>ma chere</i>?" And
with the edge of her large feather fan she tapped the knees of an
elderly lady who sat the other side of M. le General.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mademoiselle Fairfax was not listening to my foolish
remarks," General Naniescu said, turning the battery of his mellow
eyes on the somewhat frumpish old maid.</p>

<p>"No," Miss Fairfax admitted drily. "Monsieur de Kervoisin here
on my left was busy trying to convert me to the dullness of Marcel
Proust. He is not succeeding."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Naniescu suavely, "you English ladies! You are
so intellectual and so deliciously obstinate. So proud of your
glorious literature that even the French modernists appear poor in
your sight."</p>

<p>"There, you see, <i>ma chere</i>," Lady Orange put in with her
habitual vagueness, "always the courtier."</p>

<p>"How can one help being a courtier, dear lady, when for hours
one is thrown in a veritable whirlpool of beauty, brilliance and
wit? Look at this dazzling throng before us," the general went on,
with a fine sweep of his arm. "The eyes are nearly blinded with its
magnificence. Is it not so, my dear Kervoisin?"</p>

<p>This last remark he made in French, for M. de Kervoisin spoke
not a word of English. He was a small, spare man, with thin grey
beard neatly trimmed into a point, and thin grey hair carefully
arranged so as to conceal the beginnings of baldness. Around his
deep-set grey eyes there was a network of wrinkles; they were
shrewd, piercing eyes, with little, if any, softness in them. M. de
Kervoisin, whose name proclaimed him a native of Brittany, was
financial adviser to a multiplicity of small, newly created states,
all of whom were under the tutelage of France. His manner was quiet
and self-effacing when social or political questions were on the
tapis, and he only appeared to warm up when literature or the arts
were being discussed. He fancied himself as a Maecenas rather than
a financier. Marcel Proust was his hobby for the moment, because
above all things he prided himself on modernity, and on his desire
to keep abreast of every literary and artistic movement that had
risen in the one country that he deemed of intellectual importance,
namely his own.</p>

<p>For the moment he felt vaguely irritated because Miss
Fairfax—a seemingly unpretentious and socially unimportant
elderly female—refused to admit that there was not a single
modern English prose writer that could compare with Proust. To the
general's direct challenge he only replied drily.</p>

<p>"Very brilliant indeed, my good Naniescu; but you know, I have
seen so much in my day that sights like these have no longer the
power to stir me."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for you," Miss Fairfax retorted with old-maidish
bluntness. "I have been about the world a good deal myself, but I
find it always a pleasure to look at pretty people. Look at
Rosemary Fowkes now," she went on, addressing no one in particular,
"did you ever in all your life see anything so beautiful?"</p>

<p>She made lively little gestures of greeting, and pointed to a
couple on the dancing-floor below. Lady Orange turned her
perpetually surprised gaze in that direction and General Naniescu
uttered an exaggerated cry of admiration. Even M. de Kervoisin
appeared interested.</p>

<p>"Who is the lady?" he asked.</p>

<p>"She is Rosemary Fowkes," Miss Fairfax said, "one of the most
distinguished—"</p>

<p>"Ah! I entreat you, mademoiselle, tell us no more," the general
exclaimed with mock protest; "a lovely woman needs no other label
but her own loveliness. She is distinguished amongst all because
she is beautiful. What else should a woman be when she is the
finest work the Creator ever produced—an enchantress?"</p>

<p>"Well." Miss Fairfax rejoined drily, "I would scold you,
general, for those lyrical effusions if they were intended for
anybody else. Pretty women are usually silly, because from
childhood upwards they have been taught to use their intellect
solely for purposes of self-contemplation and self-admiration. But
Rosemary Fowkes is an exception. She is not only beautiful, but
brilliantly clever. Surely you remember those articles in the
International Review on the subject of 'The Evils of Bureaucracy in
the Near East'? They were signed 'Uno,' and many doubted at the
time that the writer was a woman, and a young one at that."</p>

<p>"Uno?" General Naniescu exclaimed, and threw a significant
glance at M. de Kervoisin, who in his turn uttered an astonished
"Ah!" and leaned over the edge of the box in order to take a closer
view of the lady under discussion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 3</h2>

<p>Indeed no lyrical effusion would seem exaggerated if dedicated
to Rosemary Fowkes. She was one of those women on whom Nature
seemed to have showered every one of her most precious gifts. There
are few words that could adequately express the peculiar character
of her beauty. She was tall, and her figure was superb; had hair
the colour of horse-chestnuts when first they fall out of their
prickly green cases, and her skin was as delicately transparent as
egg-shell china; but Rosemary's charm did not lie in the colour of
her hair or the quality of her skin. It lay in something more
undefinable. Perhaps it was in her eyes. Surely, surely it was in
her eyes. People were wont to say they were "haunting," like the
eyes of a pixie or of a fairy. They were not blue, nor were they
green or grey, but they were all three at times, according as
Rosemary was pleased or amused or thoughtful; and when she was
pleased or amused she would screw up those pixie eyes of hers, and
three adorable little lines that were not wrinkles would form on
each side of her nose, like those on the nose of a lion cub.</p>

<p>Her chestnut-coloured hair lay in luscious waves over her
forehead and round her perfectly shaped little head, and when she
smiled her small white teeth would gleam through her full, parted
lips.</p>

<p>Eschewing the fantastic pierrot costumes of the hour, rosemary
Fowkes was dressed in a magnificent Venetian gown of the fifteenth
century, the rich crimson folds of which set off her stately figure
as well as the radiant colouring of her skin and hair. She wore a
peculiarly shaped velvet cap, the wings of which fastened under her
chin, thus accentuating the perfect oval of the face and the
exquisite contour of forehead and cheeks.</p>

<p>"A woman so beautiful has no right to be clever," General
Naniescu remarked with an affected sigh. "It is not fair to the
rest of her sex."</p>

<p>"Miss Fowkes is certainly very gifted," Lady Orange remarked
drily, her enthusiasm apparently being less keen on the subject of
Rosemary than that of Miss Fairfax.</p>

<p>"And who is the happy man," M. de Kervoisin put in in his dry,
ironic tone, "with whom the enchantress is dancing?"</p>

<p>"Peter Blakeney," Miss Fairfax replied curtly.</p>

<p>"<i>Qui ça</i>, Peter Blakeney?"</p>

<p>"Peter Blakeney, Peter Blakeney! He does not know who is Peter
Blakeney!" Lady Orange exclaimed, and for this supreme moment she
departed from her habitual vagueness of attitude, whilst her glance
became more markedly astonished than before.</p>

<p>Two or three young people who sat at the back of the box
tittered audibly, and gazed at the foreigner as if he were indeed
an extraordinary specimen lately presented to the Zoo.</p>

<p>"Remember, dear lady," General Naniescu put in, wholly
unperturbed by the sensation which his friend's query had provoked,
"that M. de Kervoisin and I are but strangers in your wonderful
country, and that no doubt it is our want of knowledge of your
language that causes us to seem ignorant of some of your greatest
names in literature or the Arts."</p>

<p>"It is not a case of literature or the Arts, <i>mon cher</i>
general," Lady Orange condescended to explain. "Peter Blakeney is
the finest cover-point England ever had."</p>

<p>"Ah! political sociology?" M. de Kervoisin queried blandly.</p>

<p>"Political what?"</p>

<p>"The Secret Points, no doubt you mean, dear lady?" the general
went on, politely puzzled. "Advanced Communism, what? M. Blakeney
is then a disciple of Lenin?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you are talking about," Lady Orange sighed.
"Peter Blakeney is the finest cricketer Eton and Oxford have ever
produced."</p>

<p>"Cricket!" exclaimed the general, while M. de Kervoisin uttered
a significant "Ah!"</p>

<p>There was a moment of quite uncomfortable silence. Naniescu was
thoughtfully stroking his luxurious moustache, and a gentle,
indulgent smile hovered round the thin lips of M. de Kervoisin.</p>

<p>"It is interesting," Naniescu said suavely after a moment or
two, "to see two such world-famous people given over to the
pleasure of the dance."</p>

<p>"They are excellent dancers, both of them," Lady Orange assented
placidly, even though she had a vague sense of uneasiness that the
two foreigners were laughing surreptitiously at something or at
her.</p>

<p>"And we may suppose," the general continued, "that a fine young
man like Mr. Blakeney has some other mission in life than the
playing of cricket."</p>

<p>"He hasn't time for anything else," came in indignant protest
from a young lady with shingled hair. "He plays for England, in
Australia, South Africa, all over the world. Isn't that good
enough?"</p>

<p>"More that enough, dear lady," assented Naniescu with a bland
smile. "Indeed, it were foolish to expect the greatest—what
did you call him?—secret point to waste his time on other
trifling matters." "Cover-point, mon general," Lady Orange
suggested indulgently, whilst the young people at the back broke
into uproarious mirth. "Cover-point, not secret."</p>

<p>"Peter Blakeney rowed two years in the 'Varsity eights," one of
the young people interposed, hot in the defence of a popular hero.
Then he added with characteristic English shamefacedness when
subjects of that sort are mentioned, "And he got a V.C. in the
war."</p>

<p>"He is a jolly fine chap, and ever so good-looking," rejoined
the pretty girl with the shingled hair. She shot a provocative
glance in the direction of the two ignorant dagoes who had never
even heard of Peter Blakeney, and then she added, "He couldn't help
being jolly and fine and all that, as he is the
great-grandson—"</p>

<p>"No, kid, not the great-grandson," broke in one of her
friends.</p>

<p>"Yes, the great-grandson," the young girl insisted.</p>

<p>There was a short and heated argument, while General Naniescu
and M. de Kervoisin looked courteously puzzled. Then Miss Fairfax
was appealed to.</p>

<p>"Miss Fairfax, isn't Peter Blakeney the great-grandson of the
'Scarlet Pimpernel'?"</p>

<p>And Miss Fairfax, who knew everything, settled the point.</p>

<p>"Peter," she said, "is the great-grandson of Jack Blakeney, who
was known as the Little Pimpernel, and was the Scarlet Pimpernel's
eldest son. In face and in figure he is the image of that wonderful
portrait by Romney of Sir Percy Blakeney."</p>

<p>"Hurrah for me!" exclaimed the one who had been right whilst the
pretty girl with the shingled hair threw a glance at the handsome
Roumanian which conveyed an eloquent "So there!"</p>

<p>General Naniescu shrugged amiably.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, "now I understand. When one gets the youth of
England on the subject of its Scarlet Pimpernel, one can only smile
and hold one's tongue."</p>

<p>"I think," Miss Fairfax concluded, "that Peter is the
best-looking and the best-dressed man in the hall to-night."</p>

<p>"You stab me to the heart, dear lady," the general protested
with mock chagrin, "though I am willing to admit that the
descendant of your national hero has much of his mother's good
looks."</p>

<p>"Did you know Mrs. Blakeney, then?"</p>

<p>"Only by sight and before her marriage. She was a Hungarian lady
of title, Baroness Heves," General Naniescu replied, with a shrug
that had in it a vague suggestion of contempt. "I guessed that our
young cricket player was her son from the way he wears the
Hungarian national dress."</p>

<p>"I was wondering what that dress was," Lady Orange remarked
vaguely, thankful that the conversation had drifted back to a more
equable atmosphere. "It is very picturesque and very becoming."</p>

<p>"And quite medieval and Asiatic, do you not think so, dear lady?
The Hungarian aristocrats used to go to their Court dressed in that
barbaric fashion in the years before the war."</p>

<p>"And very handsome they must have looked, judging by Peter
Blakeney's appearance to-night."</p>

<p>"I knew the mother, too," Miss Fairfax remarked gently; "she was
a dear."</p>

<p>"She is dead, then?" M. de Kervoisin asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, some years ago, my dear friend," the general replied.
"It was a tragic story, I remember, but I have forgotten its
details."</p>

<p>"No one ever knew it over here," was Miss Fairfax's somewhat
terse comment, which seemed to suggest that further discussion on
the subject would be unwelcome.</p>

<p>General Naniescu, nevertheless, went on with an indifferent
shrug and that same slightly contemptuous tone in his voice.
"Hungarian women are most of them ill-balanced. But by your leave,
gracious ladies, we will not trouble our heads any longer with that
man, distinguished though his cricket-playing career may have been.
To me he is chiefly interesting because he dances in perfect
harmony with Venus Aphrodite."</p>

<p>"Whose Vulcan, I imagine, he would gladly be," M. de Kervoisin
remarked with a smile.</p>

<p>"A desire shared probably by many, or is the one and only Vulcan
already found?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in the person of Lord Tarkington," Miss Fairfax
replied.</p>

<p>"<i>Qui ça</i> Lord Tarkington?" the general queried again.</p>

<p>"You are determined to know everything, <i>mon cher</i>
general," Lady Orange retorted playfully.</p>

<p>"Ah, but Mademoiselle Fairfax is such a wonderful encyclopedia
of social science, and since my attention has been purposefully
drawn to Aphrodite, my curiosity with regard to Vulcan must be
satisfied. Mademoiselle, I beg you to tell me all about him."</p>

<p>"Well," Julia Fairfax resumed good-humouredly, "all I can tell
you is that Jasper Tarkington is one of the few rich peers left in
England; and this is all the more remarkable as his uncle, the late
Lord Tarkington, was one of the poorest. Nobody seems to know where
Jasper got his money. I believe that he practically owns one of the
most prosperous seaside towns on the South Coast. I forget which.
Anyway, he is in a position to give Rosemary just what she wants
and everything that she craves for, except perhaps—"</p>

<p>Miss Fairfax paused and shrugged her thin shoulders. Taunted by
General Naniescu, she refused to complete the sentence she had so
tantalizingly left half spoken.</p>

<p>"Lord Tarkington is a great friend of your country, General
Naniescu," she said abruptly. "Surely you must know him?"</p>

<p>"Tarkington?" the general mused. "Tarkington? I ought to
remember, but—"</p>

<p>"He was correspondent for the Daily Post at the time that your
troops marched into Hungary in 1919."</p>

<p>"Surely you are mistaken, dear lady. Tarkington? I am sure I
should remember the name. My poor misjudged country has so few
friends in England I should not be likely to forget."</p>

<p>"Lord Tarkington only came into the title on the death of his
uncle a year ago," Lady Orange condescended to explain.</p>

<p>"And he was called something else before that," the general
sighed affectedly. "Ah, your English titles! Another difficulty we
poor foreigners encounter when we come to your wonderful country. I
knew once an English gentleman who used to come to Roumania to
shoot with a friend of mine. He came four times in four years and
every time he had a different name."</p>

<p>"<i>Delicieux!</i>" Lady Orange murmured, feeling that in this
statement the Roumanian general was paying an unconscious tribute
to the English aristocracy. "Do tell me who it was, <i>mon cher</i>
general ."</p>

<p>"I cannot exactly tell you who he was, kind lady. When first I
knew the gentleman he was Mr. Oldemarsh. Then somebody died and he
became Lord Henly Oldemarsh. The following year somebody else died
and he was Viscount Rawcliffe, and when last I saw him he was the
Marquis of Barchester. Since then I have lost sight of him, but I
have no doubt that when I see him he will have changed his name
again."</p>

<p>"<i>Vous etes vraiment delicieux, mon cher</i>," Lady Orange
exclaimed, more convinced than ever that there was only one
aristocracy in the whole of Europe, and that was the English. "No
wonder you were puzzled."</p>

<p>She would have liked to have entered on a long dissertation on a
subject which interested her more than any other—a
dissertation which would have embraced the Domesday Book and the
entire feudal system; but Naniescu and Miss Fairfax were once more
discussing Rosemary Fowkes and her fiancé.</p>

<p>"I suppose," the Roumanian was saying, "that Lord Tarkington has
given up journalism altogether now?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Miss Fairfax replied. "Lord Tarkington never
talks about himself. But Rosemary will never give up her work. She
may be in love with Jasper for the moment, but she is permanently
enamoured of power, of social and political power, which her clever
pen will always secure for her, in a greater degree even than
Tarkington's wealth and position."</p>

<p>"Power?" the general said thoughtfully. "Ah, yes. The writer of
those articles in the International Review can lay just claim to
political power. They did my unfortunate country a good deal of
harm at that time, for they appeared as a part of that insidious
propaganda which we are too proud, and alas! also too poor, to
combat adequately. Over here in England people do not appear to
understand how difficult it is to subdue a set of rebellious,
arrogant people like the Hungarians, who don't seem to have
realized yet that they have lost the war."</p>

<p>Lady Orange gave a little scream of horror.</p>

<p>"<i>Pour l'amour de Dieu</i>," she exclaimed, "keep away from
politics, <i>mon cher</i> general."</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons, gracious friend," he retorted meekly, "the
sight of that lovely lady who did my poor country so much harm
brought words to my tongue which should have remained unspoken in
your presence."</p>

<p>"I expect you would be interested to meet Rosemary," said the
practical Miss Fairfax, with her slightly malicious smile. "You
might convert her, you know."</p>

<p>"My only wish would be," General Naniescu replied with obvious
sincerity, "to make her see the truth. It would indeed be an honour
to pay my devoirs to the lovely 'Uno'."</p>

<p>"I can arrange that for you easily enough," rejoined Lady
Orange.</p>

<p>She leaned over the edge of the box, and with that playful
gesture which seemed habitual to her she tapped with her fan the
shoulder of a man who was standing just below, talking to a
friend.</p>

<p>"When this dance is over, George," she said to him, "tell
Rosemary Fowkes to come into my box."</p>

<p>"Tell her that a distinguished Roumanian desires to lay his
homage at her feet," Miss Fairfax added bluntly.</p>

<p>"Do you think Sir George will prevail on the divinity?" the
general asked eagerly.</p>

<p>Just then the dance was over, the coloured musicians ceased to
bawl, and there was a general movement and confusion down below
through which Sir George Orange, ever obedient to his wife's
commands could be seen vainly striving to find a beautiful needle
in a tumbled and unruly haystack. He came back to the side of his
wife's box after a while.</p>

<p>"I can't find her," he said apologetically. "She has probably
gone to get an ice or something. Tarkington was also looking for
her."</p>

<p>"Well," said Lady Orange placidly, turning her surprised gaze on
General Naniescu, "suppose you and M. de Kervoisin take us up to
supper in the meanwhile. We'll capture Rosemary later, I promise
you."</p>

<p>The party in the box broke up. The young people went downstairs
to dance whilst the two foreigners gallantly escorted the elderly
ladies up innumerable flights of stairs to a cold and cheerless
upper story, where an exceedingly indigestible supper washed down
with salad dressing and coloured soda-water was served to Pierrots,
Marie Antoinettes, Indian squaws, and others who crowded round the
tables and fought eagerly for unwashed forks and glasses of
doubtful cleanliness.</p>

<p>The Five Arts' Ball was indeed a huge success.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 4</h2>

<p>"Would you like anything?" Peter Blakeney asked of his partner
while he steered her clear of the crowded dancing floor.</p>

<p>"I am rather thirsty," Rosemary replied, "but I could not stand
that awful supper upstairs."</p>

<p>"Well, look here," he urged, "you slip into one of the empty
boxes and I'll forage for you."</p>

<p>They found a box on the upper tier, the occupants of which had
probably gone off to supper. Rosemary sat down and pulled the
curtain forward; thus ensconced in a cosy corner of the box she
drew a contented little sigh, glad to be in the dark and alone.
Peter went to forage and she remained quite still,
gazing—unseeing—on the moving crowd below. She was hot
and felt rather breathless, her chestnut hair, below the velvet
cap, clung against her forehead, and tiny beads of moisture
appeared round the wings of her delicately modelled nose. The last
dance had been intoxicating. Peter was a perfect dancer. Rosemary
sighed again quite involuntarily: it was a little sigh of regret
for those golden minutes that had gone by all too rapidly. Jasper,
she reflected, would never make a dancer, but he would make a kind,
considerate, always thoughtful husband. The kindest husband any
woman could wish for.</p>

<p>Her eyes now sought the dancing floor more insistently. She had
just become aware of Jasper's tall figure moving aimlessly amidst
the crowd. Dear, kind Jasper! He was looking for her, of course.
Always not physically and actually, then with his thoughts, trying
to find her, to understand her, to guess at an unspoken wish.</p>

<p>"Dear, kind Jasper," Rosemary sighed and closed her eyes, in
order to shut out that sudden glimpse she had just had of Jasper's
anxious gaze scanning the crowd—in search of her. She pulled
the curtain an inch or two farther forward, pushed back her chair
deeper into the shadow.</p>

<p>Peter returned, carrying a bottle of champagne and a
tumbler.</p>

<p>"Will this do?" he asked, and busied himself with the cork.</p>

<p>"Delicious," she replied, "but what about you?"</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you have only brought one glass."</p>

<p>"The only one I could get. There's a regular fight up there for
crockery."</p>

<p>She laughed. "It must be horrible up there." She exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Dante's Inferno," he assented laconically.</p>

<p>He filled the glass till the froth bubbled over and then gave it
to her to drink, which she did with delight.</p>

<p>"Lovely," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>He watched her as she screwed up her eyes and those tantalizing
little lines appeared at the sides of her nose.</p>

<p>"I hear you did splendidly at Lord's this afternoon, Peter," she
said. "There's a wonderful article about you in the Evening
Post."</p>

<p>Then she held the glass out to be refilled. "Your turn next,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Won't you have some more?"</p>

<p>"Not just now, thank you."</p>

<p>He put the bottle down on the floor, then put out his hand to
take the glass from her. As he did so his fingers closed over hers.
She tried to withdraw her hand, and it the brief struggle the glass
fell between them and was smashed to smithereens.</p>

<p>"Our one and only glass," Rosemary exclaimed. "Please, Peter,"
she went on with a nervous little laugh, "will you release my
hand?"</p>

<p>"No," he replied, and increased the pressure on her struggling
fingers. "I have often been allowed to hold your hand before. Why
not now?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders and ceased to struggle.</p>

<p>"Am I never to be allowed to hold your hand again?" he
insisted.</p>

<p>But her head now was turned away; she was apparently deeply
interested in the crowd below.</p>

<p>"Oh, Peter," she exclaimed lightly, "do look at Mrs. Opert in
that girlish 1840 costume. Did you ever see anything more
ludicrous? Do look at her huge feet in those wee sandals. There's
Jimmy Ransome talking to her now—"</p>

<p>Again she tried to withdraw her hand and still he held her fast.
She turned to him with a frown.</p>

<p>"Peter," she said, "if you are going to be foolish, I'll
go."</p>

<p>"What do you call being foolish?" he retorted. "Holding your
hand? I held you in my arms just now while we danced."</p>

<p>"I call it being foolish, Peter," she retorted coolly. "Would
you rather I called it disloyal?"</p>

<p>"You are too clever to do that, Rosemary," he rejoined,
"disloyalty being so essentially a feminine attribute."</p>

<p>"Peter!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know! I know!" he went on, quite slowly, and then
suddenly released her hand. "Presently you will be Jasper's wife,
the wife of my best friend. And if I happen to hold your hand just
one instant longer than convention permits I shall be called
disloyal, a cad—any ugly word that takes your fancy or the
moment. So I must become less than a friend—less than a
distant cousin—I must not hold your hand—the others
may—I may not. They may come near you, look into your
eyes—see you smile—my God! Rosemary, am I never to look
into those glorious eyes of yours again?"</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed as if she was going to give him a direct
answer, a soft flush rose to her cheeks, and there was a quick
intake of her breath as if words would tumble out that she was
determined to suppress. The struggle only lasted for a second. The
next she had thrown back her head and burst into a peal of
laughter.</p>

<p>"Why, Peter," she exclaimed, and turned great, serious eyes upon
him, "I never knew before that you read Browning."</p>

<p>Her laugh had half sobered him. But evidently he had not grasped
her meaning, for he frowned and murmured puzzled: "Browning?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," she said gaily. "I forgot exactly how it goes, but
it is something like this: 'I will hold your hand, just as long as
all may, Or so very little longer.'"</p>

<p>He made no sign that her flippancy had hurt him; he sat down
beside her, his hands clasped between his knees.</p>

<p>"Why should you hate me so, Rosemary?" he asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Hate you, my dear Peter?" she exclaimed. "Whatever put that
quaint notion into your head? The heat must have been too much for
you this afternoon. You never will wear a cap."</p>

<p>"I know that I am beneath contempt, of course," he insisted,
"but when one despises a poor creature like me, it seems wanton
cruelty just to kick it."</p>

<p>"I did not mean to hurt you, Peter," Rosemary rejoined more
gently, "But when you are trying to talk nonsense, I must in
self-defence bring you back to sanity."</p>

<p>"Nonsense? Would to God I could talk nonsense, act nonsense,
live nonsense. Would to God my poor brain did refuse to take in the
fact that you have promised to become Jasper's wife, and that I
like a fool, have lost you for ever."</p>

<p>"Lost me, Peter?" she retorted, with just the faintest tremor of
bitterness in her voice. "I don't think you ever sought me very
seriously, did you?"</p>

<p>"I have loved you, Rosemary," Peter Blakeney said very slowly
and very deliberately, "from the first moment I set eyes on
you."</p>

<p>Then, as the girl shrugged her shoulders with an obvious attempt
at indifference, he said more insistently: "You knew it,
Rosemary."</p>

<p>"I know that you often said so, Peter," she replied coldly.</p>

<p>"You knew it that night on the river when you lay in my arms
just like a lovely pixie, with your haunting eyes closed and your
lips pressed to mine. You knew it then, Rosemary," he insisted.</p>

<p>But now she would no longer trust herself to speak. She had
drawn herself farther back within the shadows. All that Peter could
see of her was the exquisite oval of her face like a cameo carved
against the dark, indefinite background. Her eyes he could not see,
for they were veiled by the delicate, blue-veined lids, but he had
a glimpse of her breast like mother-of-pearl, and of her small hand
clinging tightly to the protecting curtain. The rest of her,
swathed in the rich folds of her brocaded gown, was merged in the
shadows, her auburn hair hidden by the velvet cap. Just by looking
at her face, and on that clinging hand, he knew that everything
within her was urging her to flee, was warning her not to listen,
not to allow her memory to recall that wonderful night in June, on
the river, when the tall grasses bending to the breeze, and a
nightingale in the big walnut tree sang a lullaby to its mate.
Intuitively he knew that she wished to flee, but that a certain
something held her back, forced her to listen—a certain
something that was a spell, an enchantment, or just the arms of her
sister—pixies that clung around her and would not let her
go.</p>

<p>"Don't let us talk about the past, Peter," she murmured at last
involuntarily, with a pathetic note of appeal in her voice.</p>

<p>"I mean to talk about it, Rosemary," he retorted quietly, "just
this once more. After that I will fall out of your life. You can
cast me out and I will become one of the crowd. I won't even take
your hand, I will try not to see you, not even in my dreams. Though
every inflection of your voice makes my bones ache with longing, I
shall try not to listen. Just now I held you while we danced; you
never once looked at me, but I held you closer than any man ever
held woman before. I held you with my soul and heart and
body—just now and for the last time. And though you never
looked at me once, Rosemary, you allowed me to hold you as I
did—not your body only, but your soul—and whilst we
danced and your sweet breath fanned my cheek you belonged to me as
completely as you did that night on the river, even though you have
pledged your word to Jasper. Though why you did that," he added,
with a quaint change of mood, "God alone knows."</p>

<p>"Jasper wants me," she murmured. "He loves me. He sets me above
his ambition—"</p>

<p>Peter Blakeney gave a harsh, mirthless laugh.</p>

<p>"Dear old Jasper," he said, "even he would laugh to hear you say
that. Ambition! There's no room for ambition in the scheme of
Jasper's life. How can a man be ambitious when all the beneficent
genii of this world presided at his birth and showered gifts into
his lap? It is we, poor devils, who have ambitions—and see
them unfulfilled."</p>

<p>"Ambitions which you set above your love, above everything,"
Rosemary broke in, and turned to look him straight in the eyes.
"You talk of love, Peter," she went on with sudden vehemence, while
the sharp words came tumbling out at last as if from the depths of
her overburdened heart. "What do you know of love? You are quite
right, I did lay in your arms that night, loving you with my whole
being, my soul seeking yours and finding it in that unforgettable
kiss. My God! How I could have loved you, Peter! But you? What were
your thoughts of me the next day, and the next day after that,
whilst I waited in suspense which turned to torture for a word from
you that would recall that hour? What were your thoughts? Where
were you? I was waiting for you at the Lascelles as you had
promised you would come over from Oxford the very next day. You did
not come—not for days—weeks—"</p>

<p>"Rosemary!"</p>

<p>"Not for days—weeks—" she insisted, "and I waited
for a sign—a letter—"</p>

<p>"Rosemary, at the time you understood!"</p>

<p>"I only understood," she retorted with cold irony, "that you
blamed yourself for having engaged my young affections—that
you had your way to make in the world before you could think of
asking a girl to share your poverty—and so on—and so
on—every time we met—and in every letter you
wrote—whilst I—</p>

<p>"Whilst you did not understand, Peter," she went on more calmly.
"Whilst you spoke of the future, of winning fame and
fortune—"</p>

<p>"For you, Rosemary!" he cried involuntarily, and buried his head
in his hands. "I was only thinking of you—"</p>

<p>"You were not thinking of me, Peter, or you would have known
that there was no poverty or toil I would not gladly have shared
with the man I loved."</p>

<p>"Yes! poverty—toil—on an equal footing. Rosemary;
but you were rich, famous: already you had the world at your
feet—"</p>

<p>"And you did not care for me enough, Peter," she said with a
note of fatality in her voice, "to accept wealth, comfort, help in
your career from me—</p>

<p>"Peter Blakeney the cricketer," he declaimed with biting
sarcasm; "don't you know, he is the husband of Rosemary Fowkes now.
What a glorious career for a man, eh, to be the husband of a
world-famous wife?"</p>

<p>"It would only have been for a time," she protested.</p>

<p>"A time during which youth would have flown away on the wings of
life, taking with it honour, manhood, dignity—"</p>

<p>"And love?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>There was silence between them after that. The last word had
been spoken, the immutable word of Fate. Peter still sat with his
head buried in his hands, his elbows resting on his knees—a
hunched up figure weighed down by the heavy hand of an inexorable
past.</p>

<p>Rosemary looked down at the bent head, and there, in the shadow,
where no one could save the immortal recorder of sorrows and of
tears, a look of great tenderness and of pity crept into her
haunting eyes. It was only for a moment. With a great effort of
will she shook herself free from the spell that for a while had
held possession of her soul. With a deliberate gesture she drew
back the curtain, so that her face and figure became all at once
flooded with light, she looked down upon the kaleidoscopic picture
below: the dusky orchestra had once more begun to belch forth
hideous sounds, and hellish screams, the puppets on the dancing
floor began one by one to resume their gyrations. Several among the
crowd, looking up, saw and recognized Rosemary: she smiled and
nodded to them, waved her fan in recognition. She was Rosemary
Fowkes once more, the most talked-of woman in England, the fiancée
of Jasper Tarkington, queen of her set, admired, adulated, the
comet of the past two seasons.</p>

<p>"There's that tiresome George Orange," she said in her coldest,
most matter-of-fact tone. "He is making desperate and ludicrous
signs. I strongly suspect him of making straight for this box.
Shall we try to give him the slip?"</p>

<p>Her quiet voice seemed to act like an anodyne on Peter's jangled
nerves. He straightened out his tall figure, quietly pulled the
chairs away, to enable her to pass. She, too, rose and prepared to
go. It seemed difficult not to say another word, or to look him
once more straight in the eyes; and yet to speak words now, after
what had just passed between them, seemed more difficult than
anything. His hand was on the door handle. The other side of the
door people were moving up and down, talking and laughing. Another
second or two and she would pass out of his sight—pass out of
his life more effectually even than she had done when she gave her
word to Jasper Tarkington. Another second. But just then she raised
her eyes, and they met his.</p>

<p>"Rosemary!" he said.</p>

<p>She shook her head and smiled gently, ironically perhaps,
indulgently also as on a rebuked child.</p>

<p>"I had better go now, Peter," she said quietly. "I feel sure
George Orange is on his way to drag me to his wife's box."</p>

<p>Just for another second he did not move.</p>

<p>"It is no use, Rosemary," he said, and in his turn smiled as on
something very dear, very precious, wholly unattainable. "It is no
use, my dear."</p>

<p>"What is no use, Peter?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Thinking that all is over."</p>

<p>"In six months' time, if I am alive," she rejoined coolly, "I
shall be Jasper Tarkington's wife."</p>

<p>"I know it, dear. Jasper is my friend, and I would not harbour
one disloyal thought against him. But you being the wife of an
enemy or of my best friend is beside the point. I cannot shut you
out of my life, strive how I may. Never. While I am as I am, and
you the exquisite creature you are, so long as we are both alive,
you will remain a part of my life. Whenever I catch a glimpse of
you, whenever I hear the sound of your voice, my soul will thrill
and long for you. Not with one thought will I be disloyal to
Jasper, for in my life you will be as an exquisite spirit, an idea
greater or less than woman. Just you. If you are happy I shall know
it. If you grieve, Heaven help the man or woman who caused your
tears. I have been a fool; yet I regret nothing. Sorrow at your
hands is sweeter than any happiness on earth."</p>

<p>It was quite dark where they stood side by side in this moment
of supreme farewell. Each felt the inevitableness of it
all—the fatality. Pride on either side had built a barrier
between them: honour and loyalty would consolidate it in the
future. Too late! Everything was too late!</p>

<p>Peter bent his knee to the ground and slowly raised the hem of
her gown to his lips. But Rosemary did not move: for that one
instant her limbs had become marble, and in her soul she prayed
that her heart, too, might turn to stone.</p>

<p>Then Peter rose and opened the door, and she passed out into the
world again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 5</h2>

<p>Outside in the corridor Rosemary met Sir George Orange, who
claimed her then and there and dragged her willy-nilly to his
wife's box. She never looked back once to see what Peter was doing.
He had become merged in the crowd, and, anyway, this was the
end.</p>

<p>She found herself presently being talked to, flattered, adulated
by the distinguished Roumanian who turned the full battery of his
mellow eyes and his persuasive tongue upon her, bent on making a
breach in the wall of her prejudices and her thinly veiled
enmity.</p>

<p>She told no one, not even Jasper, the gist of her conversation
with Naniescu. He had put a proposal before her—a proposal
which meant work for Rosemary Fowkes—the Uno of the
International Review. He had proposed that she should go to
Transylvania, study for herself the conditions now prevailing in
the territory occupied by Roumania, and publish the result of her
studies in the English and American Press. And this was just the
sort of work that Rosemary longed for, now, more than at any other
time of her life. Naniescu had played his cards well. He had known
how to flatter, insidiously, delicately, this popular writer who
had captured the public fancy, and whose influence with pen and
personality was paramount with a vast section of review and
newspaper readers in England. What he had proposed could in no way
hurt the most delicate scruples of an over-sensitive conscience,
and the proposal came as a veritable godsend to Rosemary at this
moment when her whole soul was in a turmoil of remorse, longing,
and rebellion. That her love for Peter Blakeney was not dead, she
had known well enough all along, but she had little dreamed until
this hour how completely it still possessed her, what power his
glance, his touch, his nearness still had over her. She had thought
of her love as a heap of smouldering ashes, and lo! it had proved
itself to be a devastating fire that burned fiercely beneath.</p>

<p>And Peter?</p>

<p>Peter had set the future above the present; his pride above his
love, and she, wounded to the quick, had allowed ambition and pride
to throw her into Jasper Tarkington's arms. It was all done now.
Irrevocably done. But even at the moment when she most bitterly
regretted the past, she was resolved to keep her word loyally to
Jasper. Sitting beside him in the car that took her home from the
Albert Hall ball, she allowed her hand to rest contentedly in his.
His arm was round her, and her cheek rested against his shoulder.
She did not speak, for she was very tired, but she listened,
unshrinking, to the tender words which he whispered in her ear.
Dear, kind Jasper! He had thoughts only for her. From the moment
when she finally promised that she would be his wife, he had loaded
her with delicate attentions and exquisite gifts. Every word he
spoke was soothing and restful, so different from Peter's
tempestuous outbursts, his unrestrained, passionate eloquence that
would leave her limp and bruised, unable to understand his next
mood, his sudden indifference to everything save his own future
pursuits.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 6</h2>

<p>It was only a couple of days later that Rosemary broached to
Jasper Tarkington the subject that was uppermost in her mind. She
had lunched with him at the Ritz, and they walked together across
St. James's Park to her flat in Ashley Gardens It was one of those
rare days of June which make of England one of the most desirable
countries to be alive in. The air was soft, with just that
delicious feeling of moisture in it that gives additional fragrance
to the scent of the hawthorn: it vibrated with the multitudinous
sounds of bird-song, a twitter and a singing and a whistling that
thrilled the ear with their heavenly melodies.</p>

<p>Rosemary Fowkes was very nearly as tall as her fiancée, and
Jasper Tarkington had a slight stoop which brought his eyes on a
level with hers. Scoffers were wont to say that Tarkington's stoop
was nothing but affectation; it certainly was a characteristic of
him as is a monocle with some men. His whole appearance was one of
super-refinement: he essentially gave the impression of a man who
had seen so much of the world that he had become surfeited with it,
and thoroughly weary. The weary expression was never absent from
his eyes, which were very dark and set rather close together, and
though he was quite a young man—still on the right side of
thirty—there were a good many lines round them—as well
as round his expressive mouth and firm chin. He had slender,
beautifully shaped hands which, when he walked, he kept behind his
back holding a malacca cane that was adorned with a green tassel.
There is no doubt that there was a hint of affectation about Jasper
Tarkington's appearance and manner, although in conversation he
spoke with true Anglo-Saxon directness. He was always dressed with
scrupulous correctness, and affected the Edwardian rather than the
ultra-modern modes. On the whole an arresting personality, whose
kindly expression attenuated the somewhat harsh Wellingtonian
features, and the hard outline of the narrow hatchet face.</p>

<p>Rosemary Fowkes, walking beside him in her irreproachably cut
tailor-made looked like a young Diana, radiant with youth and
health. Her skin, her eyes, her hair, the jaunty little hat she
wore, the trim shoes and neat silk stockings appeared strangely out
of harmony with the stooping figure of this disillusioned man of
the world, with that vague air of Buckingham Palace about his grey
frock coat and silk hat.</p>

<p>It was whilst walking through the park that Rosemary spoke to
her fiancé about Naniescu's proposal. Jasper listened attentively
and without interrupting her, until she herself paused, obviously
waiting for him to speak. Then he said:</p>

<p>"And you have fallen in with General Naniescu's views?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" she replied, after an instant's hesitation. "The whole
thing appeals to me very much, and I am flattered by the confidence
which the Roumanian Government apparently has in my judgement. And
of course," she added, "I am not bound in any way."</p>

<p>"Have you made any definite promises to Naniescu?"</p>

<p>"Not quite definite. I wanted first of all to consult your
wishes."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear!" Tarkington interjected, and for one instant a
light of youth and folly illumined his tired eyes. "Did I not
promise you when you made me so immeasurably happy that you should
be absolutely free to follow your career in whatever manner you
choose? I am far too proud of you to wish to hamper you in any
way."</p>

<p>"You have always been the dearest, kindest, most considerate
creature on God's earth," Rosemary rejoined, and in her eyes there
came a look so soft, so tender, so womanly, that the man on whom it
fell hardly dared to meet it. "But you are not forgetting, are you,
Jasper," she went on earnestly, "that politically we don't always
see eye to eye, you and I?"</p>

<p>"So long as we see eye to eye in other things," he said, "what
does it matter? When I asked you, my dear, to be my wife, I knew
that I would not be mating with a silly doll. I am not fatuous
enough to imagine that you would change the trend of your beliefs
in order to harmonize them with mine."</p>

<p>Rosemary made no reply for the moment. Probably had they been
alone she would have put out her hand and given his a grateful and
understanding squeeze. As it was, the tears gathered in her eyes,
for Jasper had spoken so naturally, and at the same time so nobly,
that her heart was more than ever touched by those splendid
qualities in him which his actions and his words were constantly
revealing to her. Perhaps she was nearer to being in love with
Jasper Tarkington at this hour that she had been since first he
asked her to be his wife; and when the glory of this June
afternoon, the twittering of birds, the scent of syringa and lilac
in the air brought back with nerve-racking insistence memories of
Peter's voice and Peter's touch, it was by mentally comparing the
character of the two men as she knew them that she succeeded in
casting those memories away.</p>

<p>"You are wonderfully good to me, Jasper," she sighed.</p>

<p>"One cannot," he retorted simply, "be good to that which is most
precious in life: one can only worship and be grateful. But now
tell me something more about your plans. I feel a little
bewildered, you know, at the suddenness of them."</p>

<p>"I have not yet made any definite plans," she replied, "and as I
told you, I have made no definite promise to General Naniescu. As a
matter of fact, I intend writing him a final acceptance or refusal
to-night."</p>

<p>"But you incline towards an acceptance?"</p>

<p>"Frankly, yes!"</p>

<p>"That would mean—?" he queried.</p>

<p>"That I start for Budapest within the next few days."</p>

<p>"What about your passport?"</p>

<p>"General Naniescu assured me that he would see to that."</p>

<p>"But you would not stay long in Budapest?"</p>

<p>"No, only a couple of days. I shall go straight on to
Transylvania. I have been there before, you know."</p>

<p>"No, I did not know."</p>

<p>"Peter's mother was a great friend of mine. You know I was a
motherless kid, and she took me under her wing on many, many
occasions. At one time I travelled with her a good deal, and she
took me several times with her when she went to Transylvania to
stay with her relations. I know them all. They are dears."</p>

<p>"And, of course, they are extraordinarily hospitable over
there," Tarkington admitted dryly.</p>

<p>"Hospitable to a fault! Mrs. Blakeney's sister, who is Countess
Imrey, was kindness itself to me when I was in Transylvania two
years ago for the International. In any case, I should go to her
first. The Imreys have a beautiful chateau not far from
Kolozsvár."</p>

<p>"I am afraid we must call it Cluj now," Jasper interposed with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Yes," Rosemary retorted hotly. "Aren't those little pin-pricks
damnable? Changing the name of a city that has been Hungarian for
centuries, and that has been the centre of some of the most
epoch-making movements in Hungarian history. It is mean and petty!
You must admit, Jasper," she insisted, "that it is mean and far
more galling to a proud, if conquered, nation than other more
tangible deeds of oppression. Why, even the Germans when they took
Alsace-Lorraine from France did not re-name their towns!"</p>

<p>Jasper Tarkington smiled at her vehemence.</p>

<p>"Naniescu, I perceive," he said, "has set himself a difficult
task."</p>

<p>"He has," she admitted with a merry laugh. "But I left him no
illusions on the subject. He knows that at the present moment, and
with all the knowledge which—as I reminded him—I
gathered at first hand two years ago, I am just as severe a critic
of his government as I was then. He, on the other hand, declares
that if I will divest myself of every prejudice and go to
Transylvania with an open mind, I shall understand that Roumania is
acting not only in her own, very obvious, interests, but also in
the interests of European peace. Well," Rosemary concluded gaily,
"I am going to accept General Naniescu's challenge, and I am going
to Transylvania with an open mind. I am to have a perfectly free
hand. Not a word in any article I choose to write is to be
censored: he declares that he will show me the truth, and nothing
but the truth, and that his government is only too ready to accord
me every facility for investigation and for placing the case before
the British public."</p>

<p>She paused to draw breath after this long peroration. As she
walked so freely along, the eyes of many a passer-by were cast with
undisguised admiration on the graceful girlish figure, the face
aglow with youth and animation, the sparkling eyes, the lips which
Nature had so obviously framed for a kiss. Jasper Tarkington said
nothing for the moment; when she had finished speaking he sighed,
involuntarily perhaps, and his tired eyes took on a still more
wearied look. Was it that he felt he could not altogether follow
this exquisite woman along the path of ambition which she trod with
so youthful a step? Was he just a little too old, a little to
blasé, to share all that enthusiasm, that pride, that burning
desire to live every moment of the span of life, to fill every hour
with deeds and spoken thoughts which would abide when youth had
gone?</p>

<p>Who shall say? Jasper Tarkington had never been communicative;
his best friends knew little of his life, and though he, too, in
his day had used his unquestioned mental gifts for political
journalism, he had never been the ardent propagandist that this
beautiful apostle of lost causes desired to be. His silence now
acted as a slight damper on Rosemary's enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, dear," she said gently. "I always seem to forget
that you and I are in opposite camps over this one thing."</p>

<p>"We shan't be that for long," he retorted lightly, "if
Naniescu's hopes are fulfilled."</p>

<p>Strangely enough, just as he spoke he saw General Naniescu and
M. de Kervoisin, who were entering the park at Queen Anne's Gate as
they themselves were coming out of it. The three men raised their
hats, and Rosemary gave Naniescu and his friend a pleasant nod.</p>

<p>"I don't think," Tarkington said after a moment of two, "that
our friend Naniescu will be very fond of me after this."</p>

<p>"Why?" On the contrary, "he should be grateful that you have not
tried to oppose him in any way."</p>

<p>"I am going to oppose him in one way, though," Jasper resumed
earnestly. "I don't intend to interfere with his plans or yours, my
dear, as I said before; but there is one thing I am going to ask
you, Rosemary."</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?" she asked impulsively. "I am so glad you are
going to ask me for something. All the giving has been on your side
up to now."</p>

<p>"Not so fast, little one. You mayn't be ready to do what I
want."</p>

<p>"Is that likely?" she retorted. Then added with gentle
earnestness: "There is nothing in the world I wouldn't do for you,
Jasper."</p>

<p>"Will you marry me," he asked abruptly, "before you go
away?"</p>

<p>She did not reply immediately, for in truth she was very much
taken aback. Her engagement to Jasper Tarkington was very recent,
and up to now he had not once spoken of a definite date for the
marriage. She felt herself placed in an awkward position, for the
fact that only a few seconds ago she had assured him that there was
nothing she would not do for him. And now this request for an
immediate marriage. She certainly was not prepared for it.
Everything in her urged her to refuse. The memory of that hour in
the box at the Albert Hall, her talk with Peter, her realization
that Peter still held her heart, still ruled over her thoughts;
everything, in fact, except a sense of gratitude urged her to
refuse. And yet she could not—not after what she had said,
not after all that Jasper Tarkington had done for her. While all
these thoughts were whirling in her brain as she walked along,
mechanically now, all the spring gone out of her step, something of
the joy of living gone out of her spirits, she vaguely heard
Jasper's quiet, gentle voice.</p>

<p>"You mean so much to me, Rosemary," he was saying, "that life
here in England while you were God knows where, in tribulation,
perhaps, perhaps in danger, needing me too, perhaps without knowing
it, would be unendurable. I could not do it. I should follow you,
anyway, and come as near to you as I dared, yet without the right
to look after you as closely as I would wish. Well, my dear, you
are far to womanly and kind to inflict such torture upon me. For it
would be torture, and I would go under through it all. I don't know
if you quite understand, but—"</p>

<p>There was an unusual vibration in his voice; it seemed as if,
for once, passion would get the better of his habitual restraint.
Tarkington always spoke slowly and directly, but for once words
appeared to be failing him. However, just then they turned into
Victoria Street, and the noise and bustle of traffic, his
meticulous care of Rosemary while they crossed the road, brought
him back to the prosiness of life. Nor did he speak again till they
had reached the quietude of Ashley Gardens.</p>

<p>"Will you come up?" Rosemary asked, pausing at the entrance of
one of the blocks of flats.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"I think I would like you to think it all over quietly," he
said. "I want you to remember that when I am asking you to hurry on
our marriage, I only do it because I want to have the right to look
after you. I won't interfere with you in any way whatever. I give
you my word that as my wife you will be every bit as free as you
are now—more so, really, because in that part of Europe a
married woman can claim an independence which convention absolutely
denies to a girl. In Budapest you will meet people of your own
nationality, and of your own set. I could not bear the thought that
your loveliness would leave you a ready prey to gossip or malice.
There now," he added, with a self-deprecatory smile, "I have said
more than I meant to. My first excuse is that you are more than
life to me, and as you are so precious, I foresee dangers where
perhaps none exist. My second is that I am pleading for my own
happiness—I was almost going to say for my life. you are not
like other women, Rosemary; you are above the petty conventions of
trousseaux and crowded weddings. As soon as I have your answer I
will get the special licence and we'll be married in your parish
church without fuss and ceremony. So think it over, my dear, and
let me have your answer as early to-morrow morning as you can.
Remember that I shall scarcely live until I have your answer."</p>

<p>She made no reply; only put out her hand, which he took in his.
There was no glove on it, and for a moment it seemed that in spite
of passers-by, in spite of the conventional atmosphere of this part
of London, he would raise that little hand to his lips. His eyes
rested on her with a look of passionate desire; so intense was his
gaze that suddenly she felt almost afraid. Rosemary had never seen
Jasper's eyes look quite like that. As a rule they were so gentle,
sometimes mildly ironical, at others only weary. But now it almost
seemed as if, in order to bend her will to his, he was striving to
exert some kind of power that was outside himself, as if he had
called to his aid forces that would prove more invincible than
those that were within him. The spell—it seemed like a
spell—only lasted a couple of seconds; the next instant his
look had turned to one of infinite tenderness. He patted her hand
and reiterated gently:</p>

<p>"Think it over, my dear, when you are alone."</p>

<p>Instantly she felt the tears gathering in her eyes. His
gentleness, his tender care of her, appealed to all that was truly
womanly in Rosemary Fowkes. Self-reliant, brilliantly clever,
independent in thought and actions as she was, she responded all
the more readily to a man's desire for the right to protect as well
as to cherish. Her independence had found its birth in loneliness.
Fatherless, motherless in very early life, she had soon enough
shaken herself free from any trammels that well-meaning relations
desired to put over her actions. Her genius had consolidated her
independence, but it had never stifled those vague longings for
submission and self-abnegation which are the sublime satisfaction
of a true woman's soul.</p>

<p>After Jasper Tarkington left her, and when she was alone in her
flat, Rosemary Fowkes turned to the one thing that had never failed
her in the great moments of her life. She turned to prayer. On her
knees, and with her heart filled with longing and a sorrow that she
dared not face, she prayed for help and for guidance. She had no
one to turn to but Him who said with infinite understanding and
love: "Come unto me all ye that travail and are heavy laden and I
will refresh you."</p>

<p>In the midst of worldly joys, satisfied ambition, hopes for the
future and pride in the past, Rosemary Fowkes would to-night have
felt desperately lonely and lost in bewilderment before a divided
duty—duty to self, duty to Jasper—but for the comfort
of prayer, the thought of all that lay beyond this world of ours, a
world that is so sordid and petty even at its best.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 7</h2>

<p>The next two or three weeks were like a dream for Rosemary
Fowkes. She left herself no time to think. The future beckoned to
her with enticing arms, holding prospects of activities, of work
that would fill the mind to the exclusion of memory. That evening
when she rose from her knees, she rose with a resolve, and never
for one moment after that did she allow herself an instant of
regret. She wrote a line to Jasper to tell him that she would do as
he wished; she was prepared to marry him as soon as his own
arrangements were completed.</p>

<p>She also wrote to General Naniescu, agreeing to his proposal.
She reserved to herself complete freedom of action to send any
articles or reports she chose to English or foreign Press; all that
she desired from him was a confirmatory letter, promising that
nothing she ever wrote would pass through the censor's hands. This
he at once sent her. Nothing could be more fair, more
straightforward. Rosemary's chivalrous mind responded
whole-heartedly to Naniescu's generosity, and the feeling that it
would probably be in her power to do real good, not only to
individuals but to peoples, acted as a soothing balm upon her
bruised heart.</p>

<p>On the other hand, nothing could have exceeded Jasper's kindness
and consideration during the days immediately preceding her
marriage It almost seemed as if his super-sensitive soul had
received a faint inkling of what was going on in Rosemary's mind.
Nothing appeared too onerous, no sacrifice too great where
Rosemary's comfort and desires were at stake, and at
times—such are the contradictions of a woman's
nature—she felt almost impatient with him for his
magnanimity, almost obsessed by the unselfishness of his love.</p>

<p>She only saw Peter Blakeney once before she and Jasper left for
Budapest, and that was on the day of her wedding. By one of those
involuntary blunders so peculiar to dim-sighted lovers, Jasper
Tarkington had asked Peter to be his best man. What it was that had
induced Peter to accept, Rosemary could not conjecture. His
impulses had always been strange and unaccountable, and this one
was more unaccountable than most. Perhaps he merely wished to
pander to his own mad desire to see her once again, perhaps it was
just a semi-barbaric instinct in him that pushed him to
self-torture. Rosemary by now had sufficient hold over herself to
meet him calmly; not one line in her beautiful face, not one look
in her haunting eyes, betrayed what she felt, after the wedding
ceremony, when she accepted Peter's warmly expressed good wishes
for her happiness. Even her sensitive ear could not detect the
faintest note of irony or bitterness in his voice. After that he
said a few words about the projected journey to Hungary, about
which Jasper had spoken to him. She would be seeing his relatives
there—the Imreys, the Heves. Elza Imrey was his mother's
sister and such a dear, and Philip used to be a jolly boy; but
Rosemary knew them all. She knew she would be made very welcome.
Peter ended by speaking with great earnestness about his little
cousin Anna Heves; her father, who had been Mrs. Blakeney's only
brother, was dead, and Peter had an idea that Anna was not
altogether happy.</p>

<p>"She has left home for some reason I can't quite fathom," he
said, "and lives now at Kolozsvár—I mean Cluj. She writes to
me sometimes, and when I know the exact day when you will be in
Cluj, I will write and tell her to go and see you. I suppose you
will put up at the Pannonia?"</p>

<p>Rosemary nodded and Peter went on talking about little Anna, as
he called her. "I know you will be kind to her," he said. "You
remember her as a child, of course; in a way she is still a child,
and so pretty and enthusiastic. Give her a kiss from me when you
see her."</p>

<p>Which Rosemary, of course, promised to do. Then she gave him her
hand, without saying anything, for she could not trust herself to
speak much, and he kissed it just above the wrist, but more like a
knight doing homage to his lady than a lover who gazed, perhaps for
the last time, on the woman he worshiped.</p>

<p>It was after the marriage ceremony that the dream-land in which
Rosemary had moved these past days became more intangible, more of
a spirit-world than before. The brief days in a dreary hotel at
Folkestone would have been unendurable but for her state of mind,
which almost amounted to semi-consciousness. Then came the weary
journey to Budapest, the sleepless night in the train, the awful
meals in the crowded, stuffy restaurant-car, the ceaseless
rub-a-dub-dub, rub-a-dub-dub of the wheels that bore her away
farther—ever farther from that bygone world which had become
the might-have-been. And through it all, like a ray of light, so
persistent that it ceased to impress, was Jasper's constant,
unwearying care of her. He never seemed too tired to minister to
her wants, to arrange cushions for her, a footstool, to open or
close the window, the thousand and one little attentions, in fact,
which most travellers are too self-engrossed to render.</p>

<p>And as Rosemary sat in her corner seat during those two
wearisome days gazing out of the window with eyes that failed to
take in the beauties of successive landscapes, her mind gradually
became at peace with her heart. Her youth, her buoyancy of spirits,
reasserted themselves, made her envisage life in all its brightest
aspects, as it presented itself before her with cornucopia filled
to the brim with all that made it worth the living. Work and a
noble mate! What more could heart of woman desire? And Rosemary
closed her eyes, and in a quickly fleeting dream sighed for the one
thing that would have made her life a paradise, and—still
dreaming—she felt hot tears of regret trickle slowly down her
cheeks.</p>

<p>She woke to feel Jasper's arms around her and his lips kissing
away her tears.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 8</h2>

<p>Budapest had been baking all day under a merciless sun in late
July. But at this hour the coolness of a clear moonlit evening sent
everyone out of doors. The Corso was crowded.</p>

<p>Rosemary Tarkington, on the terrace of the café sat sipping
delicious coffee and lazily watching the throng. Now and then she
would look straight out before her, and her eyes would lose all
sense of fatigue as she gazed on the incomparable panorama before
her: the ornate palace of the Hapsburgs, and the cathedral of St.
Matthias, and on the left, towering above all, high upon the rock,
the great grim fortress that for over a century had held the Turks
at bay and saved Europe from the hordes of Islam. One by one tiny
lights began to wink and to blink in the houses that rose tier upon
tier on the slopes across the river, whilst down below gaily
illuminated boats flitted to and fro upon the turbulent waters of
the Danube, carrying a burden of merry-makers home from the shady
island of Ste. Marguerite close by. The whole scene before
Rosemary's eyes was one of unrivalled picturesqueness and
animation. No town in Europe presents quite so enthralling a
spectacle, and one whose charm is still further enhanced by the
strains of those half-sad, half-voluptuous Hungarian melodies which
come to the ear from out the shadows, or from the passing river
boats, gentle as a caress, soothing to nerves and senses by their
sweet melancholy rhythm, or exhilarating when they break into their
peculiarly harmonious syncopated cadences.</p>

<p>Rosemary had specially elected to put up at the Hungaria rather
than in one of the more modern, recently built hotels. For her the
"Hungaria" was full of associations, of joyous times spent there
when she was still a schoolgirl in the days before the war. She had
travelled in Hungary and Transylvania under ideal conditions with
Mrs. Blakeney, Peter's mother, seeing the best this romantic
country had to offer, welcomed always with that large-hearted
hospitality peculiar to these kindly people. But memory recalled
more strenuous times, too, those in the early days of her
journalistic career, when her heart was filled with pity for the
sufferings of a proud and ill-starred country, whose fairest lands
had been flung like rags by thoughtless politicians as a sop to
those who had been her associates in the war until the hour when
self-interest prompted them to throw in their lot with the other
side.</p>

<p>"You must be very tired, Lady Tarkington," a pleasant voice said
close to her elbow.</p>

<p>"Not tired," Rosemary replied, "but rather dazed. The journey
over from England is slower and much more fatiguing than it used to
be."</p>

<p>Captain and Mrs. Payson were sitting beside her at the table.
Recently attached to the British Military Mission in Hungary,
Captain Payson and his young wife lived at the "Hungaria." It had
been a great pleasure for them to see Rosemary again, whom they had
known for several years, and after supper they had all foregathered
on the terrace over their coffee. Some few minutes before this
Jasper had elected to take a turn on the Corso, to stretch his legs
and to smoke a cigar, but Rosemary felt too lazy to move, and she
like to talk to the Paysons, who were genial and intellectual, and
with whom she had a great deal in common in the way of associations
and friends.</p>

<p>"The place has not altered much," Rosemary went on after a
while. "The people here are always gay and cheerful—in spite
of—of everything."</p>

<p>"Yes," little Mrs. Payson assented lightly. "Give then their
music, their delicious wines and perfect cooking, and nine out of
ten Hungarians won't care if they are ruled by King or Emperor, by
foreign tyrant or Bolshevist ruffian."</p>

<p>"I always think Ruth is wrong when she says that." Captain
Payson put in earnestly. "The Hungarians are sportsmen, as we are,
and they are taking their punishment like sportsmen. They are not
going to let the world see how much they suffer. In that way they
are very different from the Germans."</p>

<p>"They behaved with unparalleled folly," Rosemary remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes," the captain retorted, "and with commendable loyalty. The
Hungarians are a nation of gentlemen, just as the British. They,
like ourselves, are worshippers of tradition. They are royalists in
their hearts, almost to a man. Just thing what their feelings must
be whenever they look across the river and gaze on that gorgeous
palace over there, whence their anointed King has been driven by
petty foreign politicians who scarcely knew where Hungary was
situated on the map."</p>

<p>Before Rosemary could pursue the subject she caught sight of her
husband forging his way towards her between the crowded tables of
the terrace.</p>

<p>"Naniescu is down below," Jasper said as soon as he had reached
his wife's side. "I told him you were up here, and he said he
wished to pay his respects. He is talking to some friends for the
moment, but he will be here directly."</p>

<p>"Then Ruth and I had better run," Captain Payson said lightly.
"He and I are always on the verge of a quarrel when we meet."</p>

<p>He and his wife rose and took their leave; there was much
talking and laughing and promises to meet on the morrow. When they
had gone Rosemary said to her husband: "I would rather not have
seen General Naniescu to-night. I am very tired, and honestly I
don't feel at my best."</p>

<p>"I am so sorry," Jasper replied at once, full of contrition. "I
did my utmost to put him off. I knew, of course, that you must be
very tired. But he leaves Budapest early to-morrow morning. He is
going to Cluj—"</p>

<p>"Cluj?" she asked, puzzled, then laughed lightly. "Oh, ah!" she
went on. "I always forget that dear old Kolozsvár is Cluj now."</p>

<p>"Naniescu was anxious to see that our passports were quite in
order, and as this is important—"</p>

<p>"You did quite right, dear," Rosemary rejoined gently, "as you
always do. I don't suppose the general will keep us
long—though he is a terrible talker," she added with a
sigh.</p>

<p>A moment or two later the handsome Roumanian came up to
Rosemary's table.</p>

<p>"Ah, dear lady," he said, and with habitual elaborate gesture he
took her hand and raised it to his lips. "What a joy it is to see
that you have fulfilled your promise and that you are here at
last."</p>

<p>He sat down at the table but declined Jasper's offer of a
liqueur or cup of coffee.</p>

<p>"I am only here for a moment," he said, "Overwhelmed with work
and with engagements. But I thought it would save you trouble if I
just looked at your passports and saw that they were entirely in
order."</p>

<p>"That is more than kind," Rosemary rejoined, whilst Jasper went
immediately to fetch the passports. For a moment or two Rosemary
remained silent and absorbed. An indefinable something had caused
her to shrink when she felt General Naniescu's full lips upon her
hand—something hostile and portentous. The next moment this
feeling had gone, and she was ready to chide herself for it.
Naniescu was earnest, persuasive, elaborately polite in manner and
florid of speech just as he had been in London, when first he put
his proposal before her, and certainly there was not a hint of
anything sinister about him.</p>

<p>"I am looking forward to my visit to Transylvania," Rosemary
said quite gaily.</p>

<p>"You will find every official there ready to welcome you, dear
lady," Naniescu assured her. "You need only express a wish, to find
it met in every possible way. And if you should do me the honour of
requiring my personal services, needless to say that I should fly
immediately to obey your commands."</p>

<p>Rosemary shrugged her pretty shoulders.</p>

<p>"I don't anticipate any such call upon your valuable time," she
said coolly.</p>

<p>"Ah, one never knows. You, dear lady, are going amongst a
strange people," he added with a sigh. "People whose supposed
grievances have made bitter."</p>

<p>"I have old friends in Transylvania, and will feel as safe with
them as I should in my flat in London."</p>

<p>"You will stay the whole time with the Imreys?" the general
asked.</p>

<p>"Who told you I was going to stay with them?" she retorted
quickly.</p>

<p>"You yourself, dear lady," he replied, unperturbed, "or did I
merely make a shrewd guess? Anyway, on that unforgettable evening
at the Albert Hall, when first I had the honour of an introduction
to you, I saw you dancing with Mr. Blakeney. The Countess Imrey is
his mother's sister—you told me that you had friends in
Transylvania—the inference surely was obvious. I trust I have
not offended you," Naniescu went on in his most mellifluous tone,
"by the suggestion."</p>

<p>"No, no," Rosemary replied, already vexed with herself for
having unwittingly provoked the Roumanian into one of those
elaborate speeches which irritated her and gave her a vague feeling
that malicious irony lurked behind so much blandness. "Mrs.
Blakeney was a dear friend of mine; she and I travelled a great
deal together, and I stayed more than once with the Imreys, not
only at Kis-Imre, but in their beautiful house at Kolozsvár."</p>

<p>"Ah, then," the general rejoined, "if you know the house at
Cluj, you would—in the scarce probable likelihood of your
wishing to command my services—know where to find me?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I am living in the Imreys' house now."</p>

<p>"But—how can that be?" Rosemary retorted, somewhat
puzzled, for she knew that in this part of Europe the idea of
letting their house to strangers would never occur to proud,
wealthy people like the Imreys, as it does so readily to those of
their caste in England. But when General Naniescu, with an
indifferent shrug, replied dryly: "Oh, the house was a great deal
too big for the occupation of a small family. On public grounds we
cannot allow the many suffer for the whims of a few," Rosemary
frowned, no longer puzzled. She felt rather than saw that the
Roumanian's dark, mellow eyes rested on her for an instant with a
look of quiet mockery. But it was a mere flash. The next moment he
was as suave as before, and said with that perfect deference which
he had always affected when speaking to her about her work:</p>

<p>"That question, dear lady, will be one which I earnestly hope
you will approach with an open mind, and on which your brilliant
intellect will, I trust, shed the light of truth."</p>

<p>Jasper's return with the passports brought on a fresh train of
thought. Naniescu pronounced them to be in perfect order. He added
a special note and signature to the visa which had been obtained
from the Roumanian Consul in London. Rosemary was feeling very
tired and longed to go to bed, but Naniescu stayed on, talking
desultorily to Jasper about politics and social conditions, all
matters which Rosemary did not feel sufficiently alert to discuss.
Her thoughts wandered away and she scarcely heard what the two men
were saying; she was, in fact, just meditating on a polite-form of
abrupt leave-taking when something that Naniescu said arrested her
attention.</p>

<p>"My Government," the Roumanian was saying, obviously in reply to
a remark from Jasper, "is quite alive to the evil wrought by those
pernicious articles which appear from time to time in English and
American newspapers..."</p>

<p>"Then why doesn't your censor stop them?" Jasper queried
bluntly.</p>

<p>"He would, my dear Lord Tarkington," Naniescu rejoined blandly,
"he would. But those devils are so astute. How they manage to
smuggle their articles through the post I for one cannot for the
life of me make out."</p>

<p>"Ah," Rosemary put in with a smile, as quietly ironical as
Naniescu's had been a while ago, "you still carry on a strict
censorship, then? You do not believe in liberty of speech or of the
Press."</p>

<p>"We do, dear lady, indeed we do. But unfortunately the English
and American Press are so easily captured by sentimentality. Put a
case before them of supposed wrong, however preposterous and
palpably false, and they will revel in it, print it with capital
head-lines, and so capture the imagination of their sentimental,
unthinking readers that these will no longer listen to the voice of
reason or of truth. We are too proud—or perhaps not clever
enough—to combat such barefaced propaganda; a strict
censorship may be a crude weapon, but it is the only one at our
command. What would you? A man who is attacked defends himself as
best as he can."</p>

<p>"But in this case your weapon is failing you?" Jasper queried in
his quiet, incisive way. "Whoever sends those articles to England
and America is apparently too clever for you."</p>

<p>"For the moment—yes," Naniescu admitted. "But," he went on
more lightly and at last rose to take his leave, "I fear my
irresponsible prattle is keeping Lady Tarkington away from the rest
she so much needs. Dear lady, pray accept my humble homage, and my
earnest wish that your stay in our poor country will afford you all
the delight that you anticipate."</p>

<p>He raised Rosemary's hand to his lips with the same show of
gallantry that marked his every action in her presence. Just before
he finally released it he looked up with deep earnestness into her
eyes:</p>

<p>"Let me once more assure you, dear lady, that as far as you are
concerned every word you write will be transmitted in its entirety
and with all possible speed to its destination. All that you need
do is to send your articles and letters in a sealed packet
undercover to me. I give you my word of honour that you will be
satisfied."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 9</h2>

<p>Until the moment of her arrival in Cluj, Rosemary had felt
nothing but exhilaration whenever she thought of her work and of
the good which she proposed to do, thanks to the facilities so
magnanimously accorded her by Naniescu. Just for one moment at
Budapest, when she first met the handsome Roumanian, she had been
conscious of a slight feeling of mistrust, an instinctive dislike
of the man's fluent speech and affected gestures. But on reflection
she had persuaded herself that this sudden aversion was bound to
arise at first contact with those elaborate manners which pass for
gallantry in most of the Latin and Slav countries of Europe. The
contrast between Naniescu's exaggerated politeness and Jasper's
unobtrusive consideration had naturally reacted on her
sensibilities to the detriment of the Roumanian.</p>

<p>Anyway, the sensation soon wore off. She had a very happy time
in Budapest. The Paysons were charming; she met several friends,
both English and Hungarian, who made her very welcome, and Jasper
was, as usual, thoughtfulness itself. The journey across Hungary
filled her with that gentle melancholy which those limitless
expanses of earth and sky engender in the mind of imaginative
people. It was close on harvesting time, and to right and left of
the permanent way the great fields of corn stretched out like a sea
of ruddy gold to the purple line of the horizon far away. Rosemary
loved to gaze on these measureless stretches of country, whereon
for mile upon mile nothing showed above the line of waving corn
save, at rare intervals, the thatched roof of a tiny homestead
peeping from behind a clump of grey-green willow, or an isolated
well, with one gaunt arm stretched skywards, around which a herd of
young horses had halted for the midday rest. Her eyes followed with
loving intensity the winding ribbon of the dust-laden road,
bordered by tall, slender poplars or twisted acacia trees, and at
intervals the great patches of vivid green amidst the gold, where
row upon row of water-melons turned their huge, shimmering carcases
to the warmth of the sun.</p>

<p>A faint perfume of heliotrope and mignonette hung in the air,
and just for one moment Rosemary's dreamy gaze caught a glimpse of
an exquisite mirage on the far distant horizon—a vision of
towers and minarets and of a cool, shady stream painted with fairy
brush upon the moisture-laden atmosphere. It was a phantom picture
that vanished almost as soon as it appeared, but upon the watcher's
super-sensitive mind it left in its swift transit an impression as
of a magic land, a paradise the gates of which had for one brief
second been opened by celestial hands, so that she might glimpse
the garden of Eden beyond—the world of happiness and of love
which for her must ever remain elusive and unattainable.</p>

<p>The arrival at Cluj was dreary and disappointing. From Budapest
she herself had telegraphed to the hotel she knew so well, and had
sent a letter at the same time asking the proprietor to have a hot
supper ready for herself and Lord Tarkington. The hotel appeared
unfamiliar when she stepped out of the little cab which had brought
them from the station. The smiling hall-porter who used to greet
Mrs. Blakeney with respectful familiarity on arrival was no longer
there; an out-at-elbows, ill-dressed, unwashed porter took charge
of their luggage. The proprietor, he said, was not in the house,
and he himself was in charge of the place. He bluntly explained in
broken German that under the new management no meals except early
morning coffee were served in the hotel, the restaurant being now
under separate ownership. The lady and gentleman could get
something to eat there, no doubt.</p>

<p>It was all very cheerless, and to Rosemary very strange. The gay
little town of Kolozsvár, usually so full of animation at this late
evening hour, seemed already asleep. The streets were ill-lighted;
there was an air of desolation and melancholy about this place. The
hotel itself had become stuffy, dirty and ill-lighted. The
furniture looked dilapidated, the bed-linen was coarse and the
rooms none too clean. Rosemary spent a wretched night; but she was
a hardened traveller and had before now put up with worse
inconveniences that these. There was always the comforting thought
that it was the only night that she would spend in Cluj. The next
day Count Imrey's carriage and horses (he was not allowed to have a
motor-car) would be taking her and Jasper to Kis-Imre, where a big
welcome and every conceivable luxury awaited them both.</p>

<p>All that she was waiting for now was to see Anna Heves; little
Anna, as Peter called her, the pretty, enthusiastic child to whom
Rosemary had promised to give a kiss for Peter's sake. And in the
morning, just as Rosemary had finished putting up her hair and
slipped into a dressing-gown preparatory to going in to breakfast
with Jasper, there was a knock at the door and Anna came in. Sweet,
enthusiastic Anna, who gazed at her shyly with Peter's eyes and
then smiled with Peter's smile. She would have been pretty, too,
but for the unhealthy pallor of her cheeks and the dark rings that
circled her eyes—Peter's eyes!</p>

<p>"I am so ashamed, Miss Fowkes," Anna murmured shyly; but at once
Rosemary broke in, stretching out her arms:</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to kiss me, Anna?"</p>

<p>With a pathetic little cry the girl ran into Rosemary's arms,
and, her head buried on her friend's shoulder, she burst into
tears. Rosemary let her cry for a moment of two; her own eyes were
anything but dry, for with a quick glance she had taken in the
girl's changed appearance, also the shabby clothing, the worn
boots, the unmistakable air of grinding poverty and, worse still,
of insufficient food. Poor little Anna! If Peter saw her now!</p>

<p>After a few moments the girl raised her head and dabbed away her
tears. Rosemary led her to the sofa, made her sit down beside her,
and took both her thin little hands in hers.</p>

<p>"To begin with you must not call me Miss Fowkes, Anna," she
said. "I was always Rosemary, wasn't I?"</p>

<p>Anna nodded, and a wan little smile struggled round her
lips.</p>

<p>"And, you know, I am married now," Rosemary went on. "Hadn't you
heard?"</p>

<p>Anna shook her head. She could not yet trust herself to
speak.</p>

<p>"Of course," Rosemary said gaily, "how stupid of me. Jasper and
I were married very quietly in London, and we are not people of
such importance that your Hungarian papers would chronicle the
fact. My husband is Lord Tarkington, the best and kindest of men.
I'll tell him presently that you are here. He would love to see
you."</p>

<p>"No, no, Rosemary dear!" Anna broke in quickly, "don't tell Lord
Tarkington that I am here. I—I never see strangers now. You
see, I have no decent clothes, and—"</p>

<p>"Jasper would look at your sweet little face, Anna, and never
notice your clothes. And you are not going to call my husband a
stranger, are you?"</p>

<p>Then, as Anna was silent, and with head bent appeared to be
staring into nothingness, Rosemary continued lightly, even though
her heart felt heavy at sight of the havoc wrought in this young
thing by miseries at which she could still only guess.</p>

<p>"By the way, little 'un," she said, "I don't yet know what you
are doing in Kolozsvár—or Cluj—tiresome name, I never
can remember it! Your cousin, Peter Blakeney, told me I should find
you here, and that he had written to tell you I should be at the
Pannonia to-day; but that is all I know. Where is your mother?"</p>

<p>"She is still in Ujlak, of course," the girl replied more
calmly, "looking after the place as best she can. But, of course,
it is very hard and very, very difficult. They have taken away so
much of the land, some of the best pasture, over twelve hundred
acres; mother has only about two hundred left. There is not enough
for the horses' feed. Mother had to have ten brood mares destroyed
this spring. It was no use trying to keep them, and she could not
bring herself to sell them. Imagine mother having her mares killed!
It would have broken her heart, only she has had so much to endure
lately she—"</p>

<p>Once more the girl broke down; a lump in her throat choked the
bitter words. Rosemary frowned.</p>

<p>"But, then, why are you not at home with your mother, Anna? she
asked.</p>

<p>"I earn a little money here, and Marie is at home. She is
younger than I, you remember, and she was always mother's
favourite."</p>

<p>"How do you earn money, Anna? At what?"</p>

<p>Anna hesitated for a moment. She looked up and saw Rosemary's
eyes fixed questioningly upon her, and those eyes were so full of
kindness that the girl's reticence, even her bitterness, melted
under the warmth of that gaze.</p>

<p>"I help in the shop of Balog, the grocer," she replied
simply.</p>

<p>"Balog, the grocer? You?"</p>

<p>The cry of surprise, almost of horror, had come involuntarily to
Rosemary's lips. She thought of Mrs. Blakeney, the exquisite
<i>grande dame</i> who, after her marriage to Peter's father, the
eminent scientist, had won her position in English society by her
charm, her tact and that air of high breeding which is becoming so
obsolete these days. She thought of Peter himself, who had
inherited so much of his mother's charm and all her high-souled
notions of noblesse oblige, of what was due to birth and descent.
Did Peter know what little Anna was suffering under this new regime
brought about by a treaty of peace that was to bring the millennium
to all the peoples of Europe? With a sudden impulse Rosemary put
her arms once more round the shrinking little figure.</p>

<p>"Anna," she said earnestly, "I think you are absolutely
splendid! I admire your pluck more than I can say. But surely,
surely you could find more congenial work than selling
groceries!"</p>

<p>She paused a moment, her active brain at once turning to
projects that had little Anna's welfare for their aim. Little Anna
could not go on selling groceries in an obscure Roumanian town. It
was unthinkable! Surely Peter did not know. And how could Rosemary
face him with the news that she had found little Anna selling
groceries at Cluj?</p>

<p>Something must be done, and quickly, to alter such an awful
state of things. While she remained silent, thinking, and Anna,
equally silent, fidgeted with long, thin fingers the tassel of her
friend's dressing-gown, Rosemary became conscious that Jasper was
watching her from the doorway of the next room. How long he had
been standing there she did not know. She looked at him over Anna's
bent head, and, as usual, she read in his expressive face a
divination of her thoughts. It almost seemed as if, with a slight
nod of his head, he was actually approving of what she had not yet
put into words. Then he stepped back into the other room and
quietly closed the door.</p>

<p>"Listen, little one," Rosemary said eagerly. "I am here at the
invitation of the Roumanian Government; that is to say, General
Naniescu, who, I understand, is military governor of Transylvania,
has asked me to come over here and study the conditions, both
social and political. I shall be writing several articles for
English and American papers, and I simply must have a secretary for
my ordinary correspondence, and—"</p>

<p>Anna shook her head.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to type," she said rather curtly, "and I can't
do shorthand."</p>

<p>"Neither of which is necessary," Rosemary retorted.</p>

<p>Anna looked her straight in the eyes. "You don't imagine," she
said quietly, "that if your articles revealed even a particle of
the truth they would ever be allowed to pass the censor, and if
they concealed the truth you would not expect my father's daughter
to associate herself with them."</p>

<p>"That's a brave patriotic speech, Anna," Rosemary rejoined with
a triumphant little laugh, "but you need not be the least afraid.
My articles will contain the truth, and the censor will have not
power over them. I give you my word."</p>

<p>But Anna was unconvinced.</p>

<p>"Rosemary dear," she said earnestly, "don't think me ungrateful
or obstinate. Just imagine what it would mean to me to give up this
awful grinding routine that wearies me at times to such an extent
that I go into the cathedral and beg and pray to God that I might
soon die and escape from it all. But you know, dear, when one's
country is as unfortunate as ours has become, one must do one's
utmost to help and serve her, mustn't one?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course," Rosemary assented, puzzled by the girl's
strange earnestness, the glow of ardent patriotism that all at once
emanated from that drooping, slender figure; "but I don't quite see
how you are serving your country by selling groceries in Balog's
shop."</p>

<p>"No! no! not by that," Anna went on eagerly. "Oh, I know that I
can trust you, Rosemary, and you can't imagine what a relief it is
to me to have someone to talk to. I have not spoken like this to a
soul for nearly two years. And sometimes I feel as if I must choke.
But one dare not talk to anyone these days, for government spies
are everywhere. You never know who will betray you; the concierge
of your house, the woman who washes the stairs, or the beggar to
whom you give alms. Oh! I could tell you things—However all
of us who are suffering unspeakably under our new tyrants are
determined that the outside world shall hear the truth, but there
is such a strict censorship that one dare not send anything through
the post except what is absolutely banal and meaningless."</p>

<p>The girl paused a moment, her eyes wandered searchingly around
the room, rested for an instant first on one door, then on another,
as if in fear that those spies whom she so dreaded were lurking
behind them, then, satisfied that she was alone with her English
friend, whom she knew she could trust, she said abruptly:</p>

<p>"You remember my cousin, Philip Imrey?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"He always had a great talent for writing. When he was quite a
boy he used to write poetry and little stories. He is only nineteen
now; next year he will have to do his military service in the
Roumanian army, and that is a perfect hell for every Hungarian!
Just think, Rosemary, if an Englishman had to serve in the German
army! Isn't it unthinkable? But still, that cannot be helped! We
are the vanquished race, and we have to pay the price. But we are
determined that the nations of the West shall know the truth! So
Philip and I, between us, thought of a plan. We thought of it for
two years, and it took some time to organize. At last I obtained
what I wanted, mother's consent that I should come to Cluj to earn
my living, and a post in Balog's grocery shop. Balog sends
Transylvanian goods regularly to Budapest: mustard, cheese,
vegetable seeds; I have to pack them. Now do you understand?"</p>

<p>Rosemary nodded. "Yes, I think I do! Philip writes those
articles which appeared in the Evening Post and caused such an
outburst of sympathy for the Hungarians of Transylvania throughout
Great Britain. And you—?" she added, and her eyes full of
tenderness and compassion rested with undisguised admiration on the
shrinking little figure of Anna Heves.</p>

<p>"He rides over from Kis-Imre," the girl continued simply, "and
brings me the articles which he has written, and I consign them
inside the grocery parcels to the firm at Budapest, who, of course,
are in entire sympathy with us, and post them on to England. Oh! it
is splendid, Rosemary dear," the girl continued with glowing eyes,
"to be able to do all this. Now you see, don't you? that I could
not possibly give it all up."</p>

<p>"Yes, Anna, I do see that. But you are running terrible risks,
little 'un."</p>

<p>"I know I am, and so does Philip; but you don't know how happy
it makes us. The days when an article of his goes to Budapest is a
fete day for us both. It is usually a Saturday when the parcels are
sent off, and," the girl went on with pathetic naivete, "on the
Sunday morning when I go to Mass, I no longer bother God with my
troubles and with senseless prayers, I just thank Him, and thank
Him for letting me do something for Hungary."</p>

<p>Rosemary said nothing for the moment. Indeed, what could she
say? To try and dissuade this young fanatic from all her
high-souled foolishness was an attempt foredoomed to failure.
Rosemary had far too keen a knowledge of human nature, and held far
too high an opinion of patriotism as a virtue not to understand the
intense happiness that this constant sacrifice brought into Anna's
dreary life. To have suggested that the girl give up this
joy—these constant risks—would have been futile.</p>

<p>"You are a splendid, brave thing, Anna!" was all that she could
say, and her voice sounded quite harsh as she spoke, because she
was fighting against emotion.</p>

<p>She gazed with real admiration on the poor wizened little figure
of this girl, in whose soul burned a flame of ardent patriotism.
Anna had counted the cost of what she was doing; with her eyes
open, envisaging every risk, she was accomplishing quietly and
unostentatiously what she believed to be her duty to her poor
native land. A heroine of the peace, she risked more than the
thousands of heroines of the war had done—save perhaps one.
Like Edith Cavell, she faced and risked death for an ideal, happy
in her quiet way for the privilege of doing it, enduring a life of
grinding routine, of dreary monotony more trying for the young to
bear than active sorrow or physical pain.</p>

<p>The two girls had not spoken for some time, they sat side by
side on the sofa with hands clasped, and eyes fixed upon one
another. Anna, with nerves weakened by privations, was on the verge
of giving way to an emotion which would have eased the tension that
for the past months was threatening to break down her spirit.
Rosemary, on the other hand, felt for the moment almost ashamed of
her robust health, her virile brain, the contentment—if not
happiness—in life which was her portion since she had married
Jasper, and her compassionate heart longed for the power to comfort
and to help this gentle, high-souled girl who looked at her with
Peter Blakeney's eyes, and whose lips when she smiled were so like
his. Anna was running her head against a stonewall. Rosemary felt
that inevitably she would sooner or later be crushed in the
process. Her thoughts flew to her husband, the man on whom she knew
that she could always rely when knotty problems of life threatened
to be beyond her powers to unravel. Jasper would be of good
counsel: selfless, generous to a fault, his unerring tact would
perhaps find a way into the innermost recesses of Anna's heart, and
find the means to save the child from further fanatical folly
without wounding the susceptibilities of her high-mettled
patriotism.</p>

<p>"And now, Anna," Rosemary said after that moment of silence
which had sealed a bond of sympathy between herself and Peter's
kinswoman, "you are going to have a cup of hot coffee with me and
Jasper. No! No!" she went on determinedly, and took hold of the
girl's wrist. "I shall not let you go till you have seen Jasper. He
will just love you, and you and he will get on splendidly together.
You two fine creatures are made to understand one another."</p>

<p>She dragged the obviously unwilling Anna with her into the next
room. Jasper was there, waiting. His hand was on the bell-pull at
the moment, and his kind, grave, eyes at once sought those of Anna,
who, reluctantly, allowed herself to be drawn toward him.</p>

<p>Rosemary effected a quick introduction. In a moment Jasper's
kind words had gained the victory over Anna's shyness; less than
two minutes later they were seated side by side at the table, while
Rosemary ordered coffee of the slatternly chambermaid who had come
in answer to the bell.</p>

<p>It was wonderful how splendidly Jasper and Anna got on; he
seemed in a few seconds to have caught the knack of gaining the
girl's confidence. She became animated, quite pretty, with shinning
eyes and full red lips that had lost for the moment their pathetic
droop. She did not refer to her cousin, Philip Imrey, or to the
dangerous game he and she were playing together, but she talked of
her mother and of Ujlak, of the horses and the farm and the
difficulties that beset the Hungarian landowners at every turn.</p>

<p>"I dare say that to a great extent it is our fault," she was
even willing to admit in response to gentle criticism from Jasper.
"We did not make ourselves beloved by the peasantry; they spoke a
different language from ours, theirs was a different religion, and
they were the alien race. We did little, if anything, for them. But
tell me," she went on, and fixed her shrewd glance upon Jasper, "do
you think that you landowners over in England, who do so much for
your tenantry and your villagers, cricket-clubs, football,
concerts—oh! I don't know what else, but things that you pay
for and that they enjoy—well! do you think that in their
hearts they love you any better than the Roumanian peasantry loved
us Hungarians? And do you really believe that if you were in
trouble, as we are now, and they were given a certain power over
you, they would use it to show their gratitude for past generosity?
Do you really believe that, Lord Tarkington?" she insisted.</p>

<p>And Jasper, with a smile at her vehemence, could only shrug his
shoulders.</p>

<p>He was evidently very much taken with little Anna.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 10</h2>

<p>It was a week later and Jasper and Rosemary had been spending
that time at Kis-Imre. No one who has not travelled in that part of
the world can form a conception of the large-hearted hospitality
that welcomes the stranger in a Hungarian chateau.</p>

<p>And Rosemary at once took the Imreys to her heart. She had known
them before, of course, in the days before the war, when they
dispensed that same wonderful hospitality, light-heartedly, gaily,
as a matter of course.</p>

<p>But most of that had become a thing of the past. So much of it
had gone, been irretrievably lost in the cataclysm of war and alien
occupation. The will to give was still there, the love of the
stranger, the boundless hospitality, but giving now meant a
sacrifice somewhere, giving up something to give to others. All the
sweeter, all the more lovable for being tinged with sadness. To
Rosemary, Elza Imrey now was a woman' before that she had been just
like a child, naïvely proud of her home, her table, her horses,
without a hint of ostentation in her display of the rich gifts the
good God had showered upon her. Now Elza's large, prominent blue
eyes had become a little dim with constant weeping, and her mouth,
when at rest, drooped slightly at the corners. Elza was still a
very handsome woman, with her hair of ruddy gold like the
cornfields of her native land, but all around the temples there was
now a sprinkling of silver, a sprinkling that softened the face as
powder does when applied lightly to the hair.</p>

<p>Though in outward appearance she was very unlike her sister, yet
she constantly reminded Rosemary of Mrs. Blakeney; it was a
question of movements, a gesture here and there, and also the tone
of the voice. Elza, too, like her sister, had a magnificent figure,
and the perfect hands, arms and wrists peculiar to her race. She
had suffered, of course: badly during the war, terribly since the
peace. At all times a maîtresse femme, it was she who had carried
on the administration of her husband's estates, she who used to
interview bailiffs, lawyers, tenants. She had always been looked up
to by the local officials and by the surrounding peasantry as the
head of the house. Maurus Imrey had always been neurasthenic, and
the privations of the war, and the humiliations consequent on the
alien occupation of his country, had exasperated his nervous system
and further embittered his quarrelsome disposition. In the happy
days before the war his contribution to the management of his
estates consisted in grumbling daily at his chef and swearing
unremittingly at those of his servants who came to him for orders
in anything pertaining to the house. Malicious tongues were wont to
say that Maurus Imrey had gipsy blood in his veins; more likely it
was an Armenian strain. Certain it is that his face and hands were
swarthy, his nose hooked and his eyes very dark and piercing;
characteristics which he had transmitted in a softened degree to
his son Philip. But he was a man of culture for all that. He had
read a great deal and thought over what he had read. Jasper
Tarkington found him at the outset an interesting, if not very
genial, companion.</p>

<p>Then there was Philip, worshipped by his mother, adored by his
father, handsome, a splendid dancer, an accomplished musician.
Philip was very attractive; if there was gipsy blood in his veins
it had given him nothing but physical beauty and the highly
developed musical talent of that race. He had dark, curly hair, and
large mellow eyes, fringed with long lashes that would have been a
gift of the gods to a girl. Jasper at first sight pronounced him
effeminate, but Rosemary—knowing what she did about
him—would not allow this for a moment. How could a boy be
called effeminate who staked his life time and again, every time he
rode into Cluj with those newspaper articles of his in his
pocket?</p>

<p>But this, of course, Jasper did not know.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 11</h2>

<p>Elza Imrey talked very freely with Rosemary, and often referred
to her husband having taken the oath of allegiance to the King of
Roumania. It was all because of Philip. "What I am working for,"
she said, with the light almost of a fanatic in her eyes, "and what
I shall work for so long as I have breath left in my body, is to
save Philip's inheritance. The Roumanians are lying in wait for us,
watching for an excuse to expel us from Transylvania. Many have had
to go. Nothing would induce them to be false to the oath that they
had sworn to the anointed King of Hungary. So they had to go.
Sometimes at twenty-four hours' notice, bag and baggage, turned out
of the home their forbears had owned for hundreds of years. But I
would not do that. I had to think of Philip. The Roumanian
occupation is now an accomplished fact, and we are too helpless,
too friendless, not to accept it. But we must be very careful. One
false step and we are done. Imagine how I tremble every time Maurus
lets himself go. You know how unguarded he always is in his
speech."</p>

<p>Rosemary felt an actual physical pain in her heart when she
thought of this devoted mother's brave struggle to guard her son's
inheritance, and how little she guessed that Philip himself was
jeopardizing his future and risking his life in a cause that she
was proclaiming hopeless. Those rides to Cluj! The meeting with
Anna Heves! The dispatch of those newspaper articles of his! And
Government spies lurking everywhere!</p>

<p>But during meals all unpleasant subjects were vetoed. Rosemary
would have none of them, and her wishes, as the honoured guest,
were law in this hospitable house. These good people, with their
mercurial temperament, had a wonderful gift of casting aside
trouble and giving themselves over to the pleasures of the moment.
And so at dinner in the evenings the gipsy band not yet driven
forth out of the neighbouring village would discourse sweet music,
the tender, sad Hungarian refrains that appeal to the stranger
almost as much as they do to the native.</p>

<p>Rosemary, who was an exquisite dancer, longed to tread the
measure of the <i>csàrdàs</i>, the Hungarian national dance, which
begins with a dreamy, languorous slow movement, and then suddenly
breaks into a wild, mad whirl, wherein the dancer's eyes glow with
excitement, their cheeks burn like fire, and their breath comes and
goes through quivering, parted lips. Surely the merriest, maddest,
most intoxicating dance devised by a passionate
people—probably for the letting off of some inward steam that
must find vent in such rapturous movements from time, or it would
consume them with its glow.</p>

<p>"I think Lady Tarkington is quite splendid," Maurus Imrey said
to Jasper, in the intervals of beating time with hand and foot to
the ever-quickening measure of the dance. "Hey, you confounded
gipsy!" he cried, shouting to the swarthy, perspiring leader of the
band. "Quicker! Quicker! Can't you hear me speak? Do you think you
are playing a funeral march?"</p>

<p>"I think," Jasper put in, with his quiet smile, "if the
musicians put on anymore speed, Rosemary for one will be crying
'Mercy!'"</p>

<p>But for the moment Rosemary showed no sign of crying any such
thing. Her nimble feet had quickly caught the quaint, syncopated
rhythm, and Philip was a magnificent teacher. Perhaps there was
some truth in saying that he had inherited a strain of gipsy blood,
for indeed when he danced the csàrdàs there was something barbaric
about his movements. They were full of grace and perfect in rhythm,
but all the time they gave the impression of wild roamings through
desert lands, of a will that brooked to fetters and was a law unto
itself. Rosemary gave herself wholly to the pleasure of being
whirled round, turned and twisted, sometimes lifted off her feet.
All intellectuality fell away from her for the time being: she was
just like a young and beautiful animal in enjoyment of the senses
kind Nature had given her, the sound of that intoxicating music,
the feeling of unfettered movement, the scent of dying roses in
huge vases, that sent their sweet indefinable fragrance through the
heat-laden air.</p>

<p>Faster, ever faster! Little hoarse cries escaped her throat as
Philip seized her with one arm round the waist, and, lifting her
off her feet, twirled her round and round till the golden lights of
the shaded candles swam like the trail of comets before her
eyes.</p>

<p>Faster! Always faster! She could hardly see now out of her eyes;
all that she saw was Philip's dark, curly hair waving around his
forehead. The music seemed now a part of the universe, not played
by one band of musicians, but the very atmosphere itself vibrating
and resounding, forcing her to tread the measure and not to leave
off, to go on—and on—and on—always hearing the
music—always lifted off her feet and whirled round and
round—</p>

<p>Then suddenly everything ceased all at once. The music, the
movement, everything. Rosemary would have fallen, giddy, dazed, but
for the fact that Jasper, quick as lightening, had caught her in
his arms. Her instinct was to laugh.</p>

<p>"What happened?" she asked, rather wildly.</p>

<p>Then only did she look about her. First she saw Jasper's face
bending over her, but he was not looking at her: he was gazing
straight across the room. Rosemary's eyes followed his gaze. And
all at once she gave a gasp, which she smothered instantly by
clapping her hand to her mouth. The whole aspect of the room had
changed. The gipsies seemed to have shrunk into a dark corner, with
their instruments tucked hastily under their arms; they seemed to
be trying to make themselves invisible. Two of them had crawled
under the piano; only their feet, in shabby, down-at-heel shoes,
protruded under the folds of rich brocade that covered the
instrument.</p>

<p>And in the centre of the room there was a group of men, some
half-dozen, in the uniform of the Roumanian army. One of them had
his hand on Philip's shoulder. Philip stood in the midst of them;
his dark face was still flushed with the dance, his curly hair
clung to his streaming forehead. He was still panting with the
movement and excitement of a moment ago, and his eyes, dark and
glowing, wandered ceaselessly from one soldier's face to
another.</p>

<p>Under the lintel of the great double doors that gave on the hall
a couple of men servants stood, scared.</p>

<p>Rosemary's ears were buzzing and she saw everything through a
veil; the room had not yet quite ceased whirling about her, but
through the din in her ears and the hammering in her head she heard
the ominous words: "Resistance will do you no good. You had best
come quietly." They were spoken in Roumanian, which Rosemary
understood.</p>

<p>Then there came a cry like that of a wounded beast, and Maurus
Imrey jumped to his feet. With head down he charged into the
soldiers just like an infuriated bull. Of course, he was seized at
once, dragged back, forced down into a chair, where, with arms
gripped by the soldiers, he launched forth a torrent of invective
and abuse, and now and then, when he succeeded in freeing one of
his arms, he hit out to right and left with his fist.</p>

<p>One of the soldiers, who appeared to be in command, spoke to him
with cold deliberation:</p>

<p>"You are behaving like a fool, M. le Comte," he said. "For let
me tell you that if you interfere with my men in the execution of
their duty I will take you along, too."</p>

<p>Maurus's answer to this sound piece of advice was a fresh
torrent of vituperation. He shook himself free from the hands that
held him down, raised a menacing fist, and cried hoarsely:</p>

<p>"If you dare to touch me, you miserable—"</p>

<p>But suddenly stronger arms than those of the soldiers were
thrown around him and forced him back into the chair. They were his
wife's arms. Elza Imrey throughout all this had thought of nothing
but the danger to Philip. The humiliation of this descent upon her
house, the insolent attitude of the soldiers, this bringing home
the fact of alien occupation and alien government, hardly affected
her. Her one thought was Philip. The danger to Philip doubled and
trebled by his father's ungoverned temper. And, my God, if he
should strike one of the soldiers! So she held Maurus down, held
her hand across his mouth; and Rosemary could hear her whispering
in a thick, choked voice:</p>

<p>"Maurus, in God's name! Maurus, keep quiet! Maurus, for Philip's
sake, hold your tongue!"</p>

<p>He struggled desperately, but she held him as only a mother can
hold that which threatens her child. The soldier looked on with a
sardonic smile. When Maurus at last was forced into silence, he
shrugged his shoulders and said dryly:</p>

<p>"You are very wise, madame, to keep M. le Comte's temper in
check for him. My orders are that if any resistance is offered to
take all three of you along. I need not tell you that after that
you two will be sent packing out of the country, and your
son—"</p>

<p>A cry from Elza broke into his complacent speech. At once she
became humble, cringing, all the pride of the aristocrat was
submerged in the devastating anxiety of the mother. She still held
Maurus down, for she dared not loosen her hold on him, but she
turned a tear-stained face, pathetic-looking in its expression of
appeal, toward the Roumanian.</p>

<p>"You must not take any notice of his lordship, captain," she
said, trying in vain to speak lightly and to steady her voice.
"You—you have known him for years, haven't you? You
remember—he was always a little excitable—you used to
amuse yourselves—you and your brother officers—by
making him angry with one of the peasants, and seeing the men's
terror of him? You remember," she reiterated, with the same
pathetic effort at conciliation, "when we were at Tusnàd and you
were in garrison at Sinaia, you used to motor over for luncheons
and balls and—"</p>

<p>"It is not a part of a soldier's duty, madame," the young
soldier broke in curtly, "to remember such incidents. If M. le
Comte will cease to insult my men, we will leave him in peace.
Otherwise you both come with me."</p>

<p>He turned sharply on his heel and spoke with one of his men.
Apparently he was willing to give Maurus Imrey time to make up his
mind what he would do. Rosemary still could hear Elza's voice thick
and hoarse with anxiety:</p>

<p>"Maurus, in the name of Heaven—" The same refrain, the
same reiterated prayer for submission, the one thing that would
help to make Philip's lot easier. They could not do anything to
Philip, of course. What had the poor lad done? Nothing. The mother
racked her brain, thinking, thinking what he had done. Nothing. He
had taken the oath of allegiance to the new King. Next year he
would do his military service, a perfect hell; but Philip had never
grumbled. And he had never joined in with those senseless political
groups who met at night in out-of-the-way places about Cluj and
dreamed dreams of freeing Hungary one day, Philip had never done
anything so foolish. This cloud, therefore, would blow over. It was
all a mistake, a misunderstanding. With silence and submission it
would all blow over.</p>

<p>But Philip all along had never said a word. The first inkling
that he had of this sudden danger that threatened him was the grip
of a heavy hand upon his shoulder. Breathless with the dance, he
had not made a movement or uttered a word of protest. His great,
dark gipsy eyes wandered defiantly from the captain's face to those
of the men, but he asked no questions. He knew well enough what had
happened.</p>

<p>Two days ago he had ridden over to Cluj with certain newspaper
articles in his pocket. He had given them to Anna. Together the
cousins had spent one of those happy days which seemed to
compensate them for all the risks they ran. Well, he had been
suspected, spied upon and followed. The strain of fatalism which
ran through his veins with the gipsy blood of his forbear bade him
to accept the inevitable. Slowly his dark face became composed, his
lips ceased to twitch, and the roaming glance of his dark eyes
became fixed. Rosemary, looking up, saw the glance fixed upon her.
In it she read the word: "Anna!" Philip was pleading to her mutely,
desperately, for Anna. And this intuition which came to her when
she met Philip's glance gave her the power to shake off the torpor
that had invaded her limbs when the dance ceased so suddenly and
she had fallen backwards into Jasper's arms.</p>

<p>Like Philip himself, she saw what had happened. The spies, the
ride to Cluj, the articles given to Anna. And now the arrest of
Philip and the deadly peril that threatened the girl.</p>

<p>"Can we do anything?" she whispered hurriedly to Jasper, and
with quick, nervy movements she patted her hair into place and
readjusted her tumbled gown.</p>

<p>Jasper shook his head. "We should do no good by interfering," he
said gravely.</p>

<p>But Rosemary was in no mood to listen. She remembered Naniescu
and his promises, the powers he had given her, the request that she
should speak the truth. She felt that she was a force to be
conciliated, and here was the moment to test her own power.</p>

<p>Without another word she ran out of the room and then through
the great hall to the outer vestibule, where stood the telephone.
While she took down the receiver and hurriedly gave the number of
the Imrey palace at Cluj, she prayed in her heart that a few
minutes' respite would be granted her before the soldiers marched
Philip away.</p>

<p>"Hallo! Hallo! His Excellency General Naniescu! Lady Tarkington
wishes to speak with his Excellency at once!! Say it is
urgent—most urgent. Yes, Lady Tarkington, the English lady at
Kis-Imre. No, no, never mind the name, please. Just say the English
lady from Kis-Imre."</p>

<p>Another moment or two of agonizing suspense, then Naniescu's
mellow voice. Thank God! He was at home, and she was through to
him.</p>

<p>"General Naniescu? Lady Tarkington speaking! Thank you, I am
well—very well, yes, my first article goes early next week.
Yes, quite happy so far. General Naniescu, Philip Imrey has been
summarily arrested...I don't know...There's a captain in charge.
No, he did not say...Yes, I am sure it is a mistake, but the
mistake may prove fatal unless—Yes, yes! You will? Really?
To-morrow morning? You are kind. I hardly liked to ask you. Of
course, I shall be here. Will you speak to the captain yourself
now? I thank you with all my heart. Will you hold the line? I'll
send the captain to you. I don't know how to thank you. No, nothing
else to-night; but I am looking forward to thanking you myself
to-morrow morning. About ten o'clock. Yes! Thank you a thousand
times. Good night!"</p>

<p>She had hardly finished speaking when she heard the tramping of
feet coming from the drawing-room and then across the hall, and
glancing round, she saw the soldiers filing out two by two, with
their captain beside them and Philip in their midst. There was no
other sound except this tramping of feet. No protests, no shrieks.
Philip in the midst of the soldiers, and behind them Elza creeping
along, silent, watchful, her great eyes fixed upon what she could
see of her son—the dark, curly hair and sometimes the top of
his shoulder.</p>

<p>Rosemary waited until the captain was quite close to her. He
saluted and was about to pass, when, like a triumphant goddess, she
turned and faced him.</p>

<p>"His Excellency the Governor, on the telephone." she said
curtly, and held the receiver out to the young soldier. "He desires
to speak with you."</p>

<p>The Roumanian, obviously very much taken aback, looked at her
for a moment or two, frowning before he took the receiver from her.
The group of soldiers had halted, waiting for further orders.
Behind them Elza hovered, her white face and golden hair alone
visible in the gloom.</p>

<p>After that instant's hesitation the captain put the receiver to
his ear.</p>

<p>"Yes, Excellency. No, Excellency. Yes, Excellency." Then a long,
long wait, while the captain stood with the receiver against her
ear, and Elza came nearer, watching, hoping, mutely questioning;
and Rosemary, with glowing eyes and an enigmatic smile, put a
finger up to her lips. Finally: "I quite understand, Excellency.
Quite! Absolutely!" And the captain hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>Then he turned to Elza, who had drawn close to Rosemary, quite
close; he clicked his heels together and touched his <i>képi</i>
with his right hand.</p>

<p>"By order of his Excellency General Naniescu," he said, "Count
Philip Imrey is free to remain under this roof. He will give his
word of honour that he will not attempt to leave the castle until
after the arrival of his Excellency in the course of the
morning."</p>

<p>And thus the incident was closed. Philip gave the required
parole, and with more clicking of heels and salutes the young
captain marched out of the house, followed by his men. Then only
did Elza break down, when she put her arms round Philip's shoulders
and sobbed her heart out against his breast. He appeared more dazed
than relieved, and kept his eyes fixed on Rosemary, whilst with his
long, thin hand he stroked and patted his mother's hair. Rosemary
gave him an encouraging glance. "It was for Anna's sake," her
glance said mutely. "In any case, Anna will be safe."</p>

<p>And the incident being closed, she went back to the
drawing-room. Jasper held out a hand to her, and when she placed
her hand in his he raised it to his lips. She took it as a sign of
his approval, and bending down, she gave him her forehead to kiss.
He just took her face between his two palms and gazed long and
intently into her eyes.</p>

<p>He had often done that before; he loved to take hold of her
face, to feel the soft velvety cheeks against his hands, and
Rosemary would turn her pixie eyes to his and in one glance express
all the affection, the sincere regard and fervent gratitude which
she felt for him. But somehow this time it all seemed different,
more intense, almost terrifying. To a sensitive woman a man's
passion, if she cannot respond to it, is always terrifying; and of
course, Rosemary's nerves were stretched now almost to breaking
point. Else why should she be conscious of a sense of fear?</p>

<p>Jasper's gaze was not so much searching her soul as striving to
reveal his. Something in him seemed imprisoned, and he was asking
her to set that something free. A force, a power, greater even than
his love, so great that love itself became its slave. And this
Rosemary could not understand. She had experienced something of the
same sensation that afternoon in London when he had asked her to
marry him before she left for Hungary. Then, as now, she had caught
a glimpse of a whirlpool of passion which seethed beneath her
husband's grave, gentle manner. Then, as now, it had seemed to her
as if he were trying to exert some supernatural power outside
himself, to rouse an echo of his own passion in her heart. And with
that glimpse into the depths of a man's soul came the knowledge
that never would it be in her power to give soul for soul or
passion for passion. And yet the day would come—she felt it,
knew it at this moment—when the man, wearied of sentimental
doles, would demand her whole surrender—body, brain, soul,
everything, soul above all—which she would not be prepared to
give.</p>

<p>Strange that this realization, this vague feeling akin to fear,
should come to her again at this moment, when both she and Jasper
were only minor actors in the drama that had just drawn to its
close. Like most great moments in the inner life of the soul, it
only lasted for one brief flash. It left its indelible mark on
Rosemary's memory, but it lasted less than one second. The very
next she tried to recapture it, but it was gone. Jasper looked
grave and kind, as he always did, busy now with getting her
comfortably ensconced in a capacious arm-chair, with plenty of
cushions behind her back. Elza came in with Philip, and Maurus
roused himself from his apathy to hurl invectives against those
damnable, impudent Roumanians.</p>

<p>And the gipsy musicians, reassured, crawled out of their
hiding-places, and their leader, shouldering his violin, began to
play a dreamy melody. One by one the others fell in in harmony, the
'cello, the bass, the clarinet, and the inimitable czimbalom.
"There is but one beautiful girl in all the world" was the tune
that they played; its soft, languorous cadence rose and fell in the
air wherein the dying roses once more sent up their voluptuous
fragrance. Forgotten was the danger just past, the peril still
ahead. Music, the never-failing expression of emotion in these
romantic people, soothed their nerves and uttered the words which
would not rise to their lips. Elza sat with Philip's hand in hers.
Rosemary, with eyes fixed far away, caught herself gazing on the
memory picture of a dark recess in a box in the Albert Hall, with
the noise and whirl of a big social function about her, but with
the complete isolation there in the darkness; and through the
deafening noise memory conjured up a man's voice that murmured with
passionate earnestness: "It is no use, my dear, thinking that all
is over."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 12</h2>

<p>The morning was as clear as crystal, the sky of a translucent
turquoise blue. Away on the right the masses of soft-toned purple
hills stretched their undulating lines like waving veils, hiding
the mysteries of the horizon.</p>

<p>Rosemary had thrown open the windows of her bedroom and stepped
out upon the balcony. With arms outstretched she drank in the
intoxicating air, laden with the scent of heliotrope and lilies.
She had the delicious feeling of having accomplished something, of
having tested her power and found it absolute. Naniescu, on the
telephone, had been almost apologetic when she told him about
Philip's arrest. He declared that there was some mistake, and that
he himself would come over in the morning and inquire into the
matter. Rosemary was young enough to feel a naïve pleasure in her
work. That Philip Imrey was restored then and there to his mother's
arms was her work, the outcome of her position in the journalistic
and political world. And the knowledge that this was so was as
intoxicating as the fragrant air on this perfect late July
morning.</p>

<p>A moment or two later she heard the pleasant noise of the
rattling coffee-cups in the room behind her. She turned in, ready
to embrace the little housemaid who looked after her so cheerfully.
In fact, Rosemary was in a mood to embrace the whole world.
Contrary to her usual happy way, however, the little housemaid did
not look up when Rosemary came in. As a rule she would run and kiss
the gracious lady's hand, according to the pretty custom of her
country. To-day she just rattled the coffee-cups, and Rosemary
noticed that her hands were shaking and that she turned her head
very obviously away.</p>

<p>"What is it, Rosa?" Rosemary asked in her best Hungarian, of
which she had learned quite a good deal at different times. "Why
don't you come and say good morning?"</p>

<p>The kind voice and the necessity to respond to the gracious
lady's inquiry broke down the barrier of Rosa's self-control. She
raised her apron to her eyes and burst into a flood of tears. The
next moment Rosemary was by her side, her arms round the girl's
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Rosa!" she said, "Rosa! what is it? Tell me, little thing. What
is it? Who has made you cry?"</p>

<p>But Rosa only went on sobbing, and murmuring between her sobs:
"Oh, gracious lady! gracious lady! What a calamity! What a dreadful
calamity!"</p>

<p>After a few seconds of this Rosemary began to lose patience. She
was English and practical; Rosa's continued sobbing and incoherent
mutterings got on her nerves. She gave the girl a good-humoured
shake.</p>

<p>"What calamity, Rosa?" she queried. "Bless the girl! I'll smack
you, Rosa, if you don't speak."</p>

<p>Now this was a language that Rosa understood far better than a
string of kindly inquiries. She had been smacked by her mother,
almost as soon as she was born, she had been smacked by her elder
sister, by her grandmother, by her aunt and by her father while she
grew up, and when she started service in the chateau and was silly
or tiresome she had been smacked by the gracious Countess. Being
smacked did not hurt, but it acted as a tonic, and braced up Rosa's
slackened nerves. The threat of it by the gracious English lady at
once dried the well of her tears, she wiped her nose and eyes with
her apron and murmured:</p>

<p>"The gracious Count Philip—they have taken him away."</p>

<p>At first Rosemary did not take it in. She did not trust her
ears, or her knowledge of Hungarian. She must, she thought, have
misunderstood Rosa, or else Rosa was talking like a fool But
Rosemary's grasp tightened on the girl's arm, her fingers buried
themselves in the young, firm flesh.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Rosa?" she queried. "What do you mean about
the gracious count? Who has taken him away?"</p>

<p>"The soldiers, gracious lady," Rosa murmured.</p>

<p>"What soldiers?" which was a foolish question on Rosemary's
part—and she knew it. There were no soldiers now in
Transylvania except the Roumanian soldiers. But somehow the thing
would not penetrate into her brain—she felt that, too, and
wanted to give it time to sink in slowly, slowly.</p>

<p>Rosa now ventured to look the English lady in the face. Her big,
blue eyes were still swimming in tears.</p>

<p>"The Roumanian soldiers, gracious lady," she said, "the ones who
came last night."</p>

<p>"But they went away again last night, Rosa," Rosemary explained
deliberately and patiently, "they went away and the gracious Count
Philip remained at home, he went to bed as we all did. Anton must
have waited on him, as he always does."</p>

<p>But Rosa gave a deep sigh and gulped down a fresh flood of tears
that threatened to choke her.</p>

<p>"Anton did wait on the gracious count when he went to bed. But
soon after midnight the soldiers returned. Feri the night watchman
at the gate, had to let them in. They ordered him not to make a
noise, only to rouse the gracious count's valet. So Feri went to
call Anton, as quietly as he could, for the soldiers kept
threatening him that if he made a noise they would beat him. Poor
Anton nearly fainted with terror—you know, gracious lady,
Anton always was a coward. What would you?" Rosa added with a
shrug. "A gipsy."</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes!" Rosemary urged impatiently. "Go on, girl, go
on."</p>

<p>"The soldiers would not even allow Anton to dress himself. Just
as he was he had to go and rouse the gracious Count Philip. The
soldiers were threatening to burn the house down if anyone made a
noise, but I am sure that Feri and Anton were too scared to think
of screaming. The gracious count jumped out of bed: the soldiers
stood by while he dressed, but they would not allow him to take
anything with him except just the clothes he put on—no
money—not his watch—not a letter—nothing. Feri
says that the soldiers were in the house and out again in less than
a quarter of an hour. They took the gracious count with them, but
four of them remained behind; they made Feri and Anton sit together
in the lodge and kept guard over them until an hour ago. Then they
went away and Anton ran in with the news. Oh! you should have seen
the gracious countess! It was pitiable—pitiable, though she
said nothing and she did not cry. By God! My God! What is to become
of us all?"</p>

<p>The girl started wringing her hands, and her voice became loud
and shrill with the sobs that would no longer be suppressed.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Rosa, be quiet!" Rosemary said once or twice quite
mechanically. She had taken it all in at last: the trick, the awful
treachery, the cruelty of it all. She stood there beside the
sobbing girl, with hands tightly clenched and a deep frown between
her brows. She wanted to think. To think. Something would have to
be done, and done quickly. But what? Naniescu? What role did he
play in this mean trickery? Rosemary was a woman who thought
straight and acted straight: so consistently straight, in fact,
that she never could visualize treachery in others. In the wide,
wide would that attitude of mind is called the attitude of a fool.
Yet Rosemary Tarkington was anything but a fool. Perhaps she was
lacking in the intuition of evil: certain it is that at this moment
she would not allow herself to think that Naniescu was a party to
the abominable deed. The young officer, perhaps, or the local
commandant who might have a grudge against the Imreys. But
Naniescu? No!</p>

<p>She sent the girl away; Rosa's round, pink face with the round,
blue eyes and round-tipped nose was getting on her nerves. The girl
was comical in her grief, and when Rosemary looked at her she felt
an uncontrollable desire to laugh. And this would have horrified
Rosa. So she sent Rosa away.</p>

<p>A moment or two later Jasper came in, ready for breakfast. Once
glance at this face and Rosemary knew that he, too, had heard the
news.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?" Rosemary asked after she had given
him a morning kiss.</p>

<p>"My darling," Jasper replied in his cool, British manner, "I
only think that you are making a grave mistake in throwing yourself
headlong into the politics of these out-of-the-way
countries..."</p>

<p>"It is not a question of politics, Jasper," Rosemary broke in,
protesting.</p>

<p>"I know, my dear, I know. Your warm heart prompts you to
interfere there where prudence would dictate the wiser course of
closing one's eyes. You would not be the adorable woman that you
are if you acted differently. But, believe me, my darling, it is
not wise. You will only run your lovely head against a stone wall,
and in the end do no good. You must let these people fight out
their quarrels in their own way. They are not our kind; we don't
understand them. My firm conviction is that you will only do harm
by interference. Mind you, I haven't a doubt that young Imrey has
done something stupid. They are a hot-headed lot, these Hungarians,
especially the young ones, and, of course, they don't like the
present regime. The government in power has a perfect right to
protect itself against conspiracy and rebellion, even though we
outsiders may think that those conspiracies are futile, and the
measures of repression unduly harsh. Leave them alone, my dear,"
Jasper concluded more lightly, with a shrug, "and have a cup of hot
coffee."</p>

<p>He settled himself down on the sofa and tried to draw her down
to him. But Rosemary was not in the mood for sentiment. Reason
whispered to her that Jasper was right—he was always right,
worse luck!—she knew that Philip Imrey had acted
foolishly—very, very foolishly—and that, as a matter of
fact, in this case the commandant (or whoever was responsible for
Philip's arrest) was entirely within his rights. She certainly, as
an impartial spectator of events, brought here for the express
purpose of seeing the truth and nothing but the truth, could not in
conscience make capital of this incident. She had come out here
determined not to act on impulse, but to judge coolly and without
bias, and thus to consolidate her reputation as one of the foremost
women journalists of the day. With Sir Philip Gibbs as her master,
and model, she could not go back on the ideal of justice and
impartiality which she had set herself. But she did want to save
Philip Imrey from the consequences of his own folly. And, above
all, she wanted to know what had become of Anna.</p>

<p>"I cannot leave them alone, Jasper," she said slowly "I cannot.
All this petty tyranny makes my blood boil."</p>

<p>Jasper sighed somewhat impatiently. "I know, my dear, I know,"
he reiterated vaguely.</p>

<p>Rosemary did not continue the discussion for the moment; Jasper
was so right in everything he said, and Philip Imrey had been
desperately foolish. Now she blamed herself for not having worked
on Anna's mind and dissuaded her from lending herself to her
cousin's mad schemes. She mentioned Anna's name to her husband, but
Jasper, knowing nothing of the girl's dangerous activities in
Balog's grocery stores, could not, of course, see that Anna was in
any kind of danger.</p>

<p>"But," Rosemary argued, "Anna and Philip are first cousins, they
see a great deal of one another—"</p>

<p>"Do they?" Jasper ejaculated. "But even so, my dear, you surely
are not going to suppose that the Roumanian Government is going to
lay hands on all Philip Imrey's relations, just because he has run
his silly head into a noose."</p>

<p>"No! No!?" Rosemary protested vaguely.</p>

<p>But she could not say anything more on the subject of Anna. Anna
had told her everything in confidence: "I know I can trust you,
Rosemary," the child had said, and Rosemary could not betray that
confidence—not even by speaking of it all to Jasper—not
even by hinting at it. If the peril became more imminent—if
Anna herself was in danger—then perhaps. But not now.</p>

<p>Rosemary tried to swallow some breakfast, just to please Jasper,
for his kind, grave eyes looked quite sad, and she did not want to
add to his anxiety. But her thoughts were dwelling on Elza.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she could bear to see me," she said presently.</p>

<p>"You can always ask," was Jasper's wise suggestion.</p>

<p>Rosemary found Elza Imrey outwardly quite calm and resigned.
That woman had a marvellous fund of common sense and self-control.
What she suffered no one should know. Only when she read true
understanding and mute sympathy in Rosemary's eyes, she gave an
answering look which contained such a depth of sorrow and anxiety
that Rosemary's heart was overwhelmed with pity. In these few hours
Elza had aged twenty years. Anton had brought the news across from
the lodge to the chateau in the early morning as soon as the
Roumanian soldiers had gone away. The gracious countess had
received the news with extraordinary indifference, was the verdict
on the incident below stairs; Rosa was crying her eyes out, all the
men-servants went about cursing and swearing and threatening to
kill someone, but the gracious countess had not shed one tear. When
she had heard Anton's report, she asked a few questions: what suit
had the gracious count put on? did he take an overcoat? what shoes
did he wear? and so on; but never a tear. Then she said: "Very
well, Anton, you may go!" and that was all. No! No! It was not
natural. But then these great ladies!...One never knew!</p>

<p>No one ever did know to what height a mother's heroism could go.
Elza, with her heart nearly broken, thought only of what was best
for Philip.</p>

<p>"Of course, he has done nothing!" she reiterated over and over
again, "so they can't do anything to him."</p>

<p>Then her voice would break on a note of pathetic appeal; she
would seize Rosemary's hands and search the depths of her English
friend's eyes, with the look of a poor stricken animal begging for
sympathy.</p>

<p>"Can they?" she asked, and Rosemary would shake her head, not
trusting herself to speak. It was no use now rending the mother's
heart, adding another load of anxiety to the heavily burdened soul.
Elza would know soon enough. Soon enough! And she could do nothing
even if she knew now.</p>

<p>Maurus was shut up in his own apartments, tearing up and down
like a beast in its cage, raging and swearing. That was his
temperament, Elza said philosophically, with a shrug; the Armenian
blood in him. (She never would admit the gipsy strain.) Fortunately
the servants were all Hungarian; faithful and discreet. They knew
him. When he was in one of those moods they fled from him; but not
one of them would betray him. Now he was threatening to kill every
Roumanian that ever crossed his path. Well, fortunately there was
no one to hear him—only the servants, and they would hold
their tongues.</p>

<p>"Maurus won't understand," Elza explained to Rosemary, "that our
chance is submission. If they turn us out of here it will be the
end of Philip's inheritance. We must save that at all costs. What
is the sacrifice of a little pride when it means so much for
Philip's future. Things can't go on as they are—not for long,
and if only I can keep Maurus quiet, we shall have Philip back here
in a week."</p>

<p>Then she harked back on the old refrain. "He has done nothing.
They can't do anything to him. Can they?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 13</h2>

<p>Naniescu arrived soon after ten-o'clock. Rosemary heard the
hooting of his motor when it turned in at the gate, also the
general bustle, clatter, running about that ensued. Her rooms, with
the balcony overlooking the park, were on the other side of the
house, so she saw nothing of this; but somehow, after the arrival
of his Excellency, the stately chateau appeared to have lost
something of its dignified quietude. Loud voices resounded from end
to end of the galleried hall, footsteps that sounded almost
aggressive echoed along the corridors.</p>

<p>Jasper had gone down some time ago for a stroll in the park,
while Rosemary dressed. She was sorry now that she had not asked
him to be sure to come back so as to support her in her interview
with Naniescu. However, this wish was only a momentary weakness.
She had been accustomed for years past to stand on her own feet, to
act for herself, and to take swift decisions without outside
advice. So now, with a careless shrug, she turned back to the
important task of dressing; this she did with deliberate care, then
surveyed herself critically in the glass, and, having satisfied
herself that Rosemary Tarkington was in no way less beautiful than
Rosemary Fowkes had been, she settled herself down in her boudoir
with a book and waited.</p>

<p>A very few minutes later one of the men came to announce that
his Excellency General Naniescu desired to pay his respects to Lady
Tarkington.</p>

<p>He came in looking breezy and gallant. He kissed Rosemary's
hand, sat down on the chair she indicated to him, inquired after
the state of her health, her journey, her work, all in a
mellifluous voice and in execrable English. In fact, for the first
five minutes of this momentous, visit he was just a pleasant,
cheerful man of the world, exchanging banalities with a pretty
woman.</p>

<p>"<i>Et ce cher</i> Tarkington?" he queried. "How is he?"</p>

<p>"My husband will be in, in a moment or two," Rosemary replied,
trying to bring the conversation round to the all-important
subject. "He will, of course, make a point of not failing to see
you." She made a slight, insignificant pause, then she went on more
seriously: "I can assure you, M. le General, that Lord Tarkington's
interest in our dear host and hostess is just as keen as mine."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," Naniescu rejoined vaguely, with a sweep
of his well-manicured hand. "They are very foolish people, these
Imreys. And that young man! Dear lady, you have not an idea what
trouble we have with these Hungarians! They are all a little
<i>toqué!</i> What you call so admirably in your picturesque
language: they have a bee in their bonnet. What?"</p>

<p>He laughed, very pleased with himself for what he apparently
considered a little joke.</p>

<p>"A bee in their bonnet," he reiterated, still waving his white,
podgy hands about. He set his teeth together and made a sound to
represent the buzzing of bees. "Buzz-z! Just like that! But bees,"
he added curtly, "are apt to be tiresome. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"You choose to look upon the matter lightly, M. le General,"
Rosemary rejoined, with a touch of impatience, "but to these
unfortunate people the summary arrest of their only son is anything
but a light matter. On the telephone last night—"</p>

<p>"Oh, the telephone!" the general broke in with an affected sigh.
"A marvellous invention! What? But it is difficult on the telephone
to give those little nuances which are the essence of conversation.
It was wonderful to hear your melodious voice on the telephone last
evening. I was not expecting to hear it, and it was delightful!
Like a spirit voice coming from a place unseen to soothe me to
pleasant dreams."</p>

<p>He tried to capture her hand, and when she snatched it away with
obvious irritation he gave a soft, guttural laugh and gazed with a
look of bold admiration into her eyes. Rosemary felt her temper
rising, and nothing but her knowledge that this distinctly
unpleasant personage had supreme power over those she cared for
kept her impatience in check.</p>

<p>"General Naniescu," she said, quietly determined, "you must
forgive me if I cannot enter into your playful mood just now. The
only son of my very dear friend is under arrest for an offence of
which he knows nothing, and, moreover, he was arrested under
circumstances that are entirely unjustifiable, seeing that this
country is not, I presume, under martial law."</p>

<p>"Not under martial law, certainly, dear lady," Naniescu was
willing to admit, and did so with a certain measure of seriousness,
"but under strict disciplinary law, framed by a suzerain state for
the protection of its own nationals in occupied territory. But let
that pass. You graciously informed me over the telephone last night
that young Imrey was arrested, and I gave orders to the captain in
charge for his immediate release. As I intended to come over here
in the course of the morning, I was willing to let the matter stand
until I had investigated it myself."</p>

<p>"Count Philip Imrey was released at ten o'clock yesterday
evening, and rearrested in the middle of the night; he was not even
given the chance of saying goodbye to his parents, or of providing
himself with the necessary clothing and money. I imagine, M. le
General," Rosemary went on coldly, "that this was done by your
orders, or at any rate that you were not kept in ignorance of
it."</p>

<p>For the fraction of a second Naniescu hesitated; then he said
cynically:</p>

<p>"Yes; certainly I knew of it. I may even say that it was done by
my orders."</p>

<p>Rosemary suppressed a cry of indignation.</p>

<p>"Well, then?" she exclaimed hotly.</p>

<p>But Naniescu, not in the least taken aback, only retorted
blandly:</p>

<p>"And how am I to interpret that enigmatic query, dear lady?"</p>

<p>"As a challenge to justify your actions," was Rosemary's bold
reply.</p>

<p>Then, as he gave no immediate answer but allowed his mellow dark
eyes to rest with a distinctly mocking glance on her face, Rosemary
felt at a disadvantage. She was obviously not in a position to
demand explanations from a man who belonged to the governing
classes in his own country. With every belief in the power of the
press, Rosemary had far too much common sense not to realize that a
man in Naniescu's position would not put up with being dictated to,
or cross-examined, by a stranger, however influential he or she
might be. So once again she swallowed her resentment, determined
that whatever chance she had of helping the Imreys should not be
wrecked through want of tact on her part. Diplomacy, good temper,
and, if necessary, seeming complaisance, would be more likely to
win the day than any attempt at threatening.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le General," she resumed, after a while, "I know that
you will forgive me for my seeming ill-humour. I have witnessed so
much sorrow these last few hours that I suppose my nerves are
rather jarred. I know, of course, that it is not my place to
criticize the measure which your Government chooses to impose on a
subject race. As a suzerain state Roumania has a perfect right to
defend what she believes to be her own interests, and in a manner
that she thinks best. Will you forgive me the sharp words I allowed
to slip just now?"</p>

<p>And with a return of that charm of manner which even more than
beauty held most men in thrall, Rosemary put out her hand. The
gallant Roumanian, without a trace of mockery now in his large,
dark eyes, took it in both his own; then he stooped and kissed the
dainty finger-tips.</p>

<p>"And now," Rosemary went on resolutely, "that I have made amende
honorable, will you allow me to plead the Imrey's cause in all
earnestness—in the name of humanity, Monsieur le General? The
boy is only nineteen."</p>

<p>The general leaned back in his chair, his well-manicured fingers
gently stroking his silky moustache, his eyes no longer attempting
to conceal the satisfaction which he felt at seeing this
exquisitely beautiful woman in the role of a suppliant before him.
Now when she paused he gave an indifferent shrug.</p>

<p>"Dear lady," he said, "my experience of this part of the world
is that boys and girls of nineteen who give up jazzing and have not
started making love, but who choose to meddle in politics, are
veritable pests."</p>

<p>"But Philip Imrey does not meddle in politics," Rosemary
protested.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure of that?" he retorted.</p>

<p>As he said this his eyes became quite small, and piercing like
two little flaming darts; but though his sudden challenge had sent
a stab of apprehension through Rosemary's heart, her glance never
faltered, and she lied straight out, lied boldly without
hesitation, without a blush.</p>

<p>"I am quite sure," she replied.</p>

<p>And the only compunction she felt over that lie was when she
realized—as she did at once—that the Roumanian did not
believe her.</p>

<p>"Little Anna Heves did not confide in you?" he asked, with
perfect suavity.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Just what I said, dear lady. Anna Heves and Philip Imrey are
two young hotheads who have given us an infinity of trouble. For a
long time we could not find out how certain pernicious articles,
injurious to the good reputation of Roumanian, found their way into
the English and American press. Now we know."</p>

<p>"Your spy system seems more efficient than your censorship,"
Rosemary retorted bitterly.</p>

<p>"That is beside the point."</p>

<p>"Yes; the point is that those two are mere children."</p>

<p>"I dare say the judges will take that into account and deal
leniently with them."</p>

<p>"With them?" Rosemary exclaimed, and suddenly a new terror
gripped her heart. "With them? You don't mean—?"</p>

<p>"What, dear lady?" he queried suavely.</p>

<p>"That Anna—?"</p>

<p>"Anna Heves, yes; the late Baron Heves' daughter, now a
saleswoman in the shop of Balog the grocer. I often wondered how
she came to demean herself in that way. Now I understand."</p>

<p>"But surely, surely," Rosemary protested, striving in vain to
steady her voice, which was quaking with this new, this terrible
anxiety, "you have not arrested Anna Heves? The child has done
nothing—"</p>

<p>Naniescu put up his hand with a gesture of protest.</p>

<p>"Dear lady," he said, with quiet irony and in a tone one would
use to an obstinate child, "let me assure you once and for all that
the accusations against Philip Imrey and his cousin do not rest
upon assumptions, but upon facts. Anna Heves was arrested and she
will be brought to trial because she was found—actually
found, mind you—smuggling newspaper articles, defamatory to
the Government of this country, for insertion in foreign journals.
English sense of justice is reputed to be very keen; your own must
tell you that it is hardly fair to bring the battery of your charms
as a weapon to break down my sense of duty. I lay, as always, my
homage at your feet, but I should be a traitor if, whilst gazing
into your adorable eyes, I were to forget what I owe to my
country."</p>

<p>Gradually he dropped the irony out of his tone, and his voice
became once more mellifluous and tender while he leaned forward,
almost touching Rosemary's knees with his, and striving to hold her
glance with the challenge of his own. Rosemary shrank back.
Suddenly something of the truth had dawned upon her. Not all of it
just yet. It was only presently—in a few more days—that
she was destined to realize the extent to which this man—half
Oriental in his capacity for lying—had hoodwinked and cajoled
her. It was his mien, the thinly veiled insult that lurked behind
his suave speech and expressive eyes, that suddenly tore the veil
from before her own. And yet reason fought for a moment against
this wave of aversion. The man was right, unquestionably right.
Philip and Anna had been very foolish. And, what is more, they were
technically guilty of treason: there was no getting away from that;
and Rosemary could not shut her eyes to the fact that the very
lives of those she cared for were in the hands of this soft-toned
liar. At one moment she longed passionately for Jasper, the next
she would dread his coming, for she knew well enough that he, with
his straight matter-of-fact mode of thinking, would inevitably give
Naniescu his due, insist that the general was within his rights,
and advise his wife to keep clear of these imbroglios, which were
so contrary to the lenient, sportsmanlike English attitude toward a
beaten enemy.</p>

<p>On the whole she felt glad that Jasper was not here. He would
hate to see her plead. Yet plead she must. There was nothing else
to do. She must plead with fervour, plead with all the strength
that she possessed, all the eloquence that she could command.</p>

<p>"In the name of humanity!" That was her chief plea; and with
anxious eyes she searched the man's face for the first trace of
pity.</p>

<p>"Anna and Philip are so young," she urged. "Mere children."</p>

<p>But Naniescu smiled, that fat, complacent smile of his which she
had quickly learned to loathe.</p>

<p>"You would not like me," she said at one moment, "to send an
account of it to all the English and American papers. Two children,
one under eighteen, the other not yet twenty, arrested in their
beds at dead of night, brought to trial for having smuggled a few
newspaper articles through the post. If you do not deal leniently
with them—"</p>

<p>"Who said we would not deal leniently with them?" Naniescu broke
in blandly. "Surely not I. I am not their judge."</p>

<p>"General Naniescu," she retorted, "I have been in Transylvania
long enough to know that your powers here as military governor are
supreme. Leniency in this case," she urged insistently, "could only
redound to your credit, and to the credit of the country which you
serve."</p>

<p>"But frankly, dear lady, I don't see what I can do. The case has
passed out of my hands—"</p>

<p>"Send these children home with a caution, Monsieur le General,"
Rosemary went on pleading. "That is what we would do in England in
a like case."</p>

<p>"To hatch more treason," he retorted, with a shrug. "Give us
more trouble—more buzzing of bees and pestilential
backbiting—"</p>

<p>"No!" she protested hotly. "Not for that, but to be immensely
grateful to you for your generosity, and show their gratitude by
striving to work for the good of their country, hand in hand with
yours."</p>

<p>"Ah, what noble sentiments, dear lady!" General Naniescu said
with a sigh, and clapped his white, fat hands together. "I wish I
could believe that some of them will sink into those young
hotheads."</p>

<p>"They will, general, they will." Rosemary asserted eagerly. "If
you will send those two children back to their parents, I will not
leave Transylvania until you yourself are satisfied that I have
brought them to a reasonable frame of mind."</p>

<p>"A hard task, dear lady," Naniescu said, with a smile.</p>

<p>"I would undertake a harder one than that," Rosemary rejoined,
with an answering smile, "to show my appreciation of your
generosity."</p>

<p>"Words, dear lady," he said softly. "Words!"</p>

<p>"Try me!" she challenged.</p>

<p>He made no immediate reply, and suddenly his eyes again narrowed
as they had done before, and their piercing glance rested upon
Rosemary until she felt that through those heavy lids something
inimical and poisonous had touched her. She felt a little shiver
running down her spine, an unaccountable sense of apprehension
caused her to glance rapidly toward the door, where she hoped to
perceive Jasper's comforting presence. She was not afraid, of
course, nor did she regret her enthusiasm, or her advocacy of the
children's cause; but she had the sudden, vague feeling that she
had come to the brink of an abyss and that she was staring down
into unknown depths, into which unseen forces were urging her to
leap.</p>

<p>Slowly Naniescu's eyes reopened and the mellow expression crept
back into them; he gave a sigh of satisfaction, and settled himself
down once more comfortably on the cushions of the chair.</p>

<p>"I am happy indeed, dear lady," he began, "that you yourself
should have made an offer, which I hardly dared place before
you."</p>

<p>"An offer? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Surely that was your intention, was it not, to do something in
return for the heavy sacrifice you are asking of me?"</p>

<p>"Sacrifice?" Rosemary queried, frowning. "What sacrifice?"</p>

<p>"Sacrifice of my convictions. Duty calls me to very insistently
in the matter of those young traitors whom you, dear lady, are
pleased to refer to as children. I know that I should be doing
wrong in giving them the chance of doing more mischief. I know it,"
he reiterated emphatically, "with as much certainty as I do the
fact that they will not give up trying to do mischief.
But—"</p>

<p>He paused and fell to studying with obvious satisfaction
Rosemary's beautiful eager eyes fixed intently upon him.</p>

<p>"But what, Monsieur le General?" she asked.</p>

<p>"But I am prepared to make the sacrifice of my convictions at
your bidding, if you, on the other hand, will do the same at
mine."</p>

<p>Rosemary's frown deepened. "I don't think I quite understand,"
she said.</p>

<p>"No," he retorted; "but you will—soon. Let me explain.
You, dear lady, have come to Transylvania wrapped in prejudice as
in sheet-armour against my unfortunate country. Oh, yes, you have,"
he went on blandly, checking with an elegant gesture the cry of
protest that had risen to Rosemary's lips. "I am even prepared to
admit that nothing that you have seen in these first few days has
tended to pierce that armour of prejudice. Well, well!" and the
general sighed again in that affected way of his. "You have one of
your wonderful sayings in England that exactly meets this case:
'East is East,' you say, 'and West is West.' This is the East
really, and you Occidentals will never think as we do. But I am
wandering from my point, and you, dear lady, are getting impatient.
Having admitted everything that you would wish me to admit, I now
will come forward with my little proposition—what?"</p>

<p>"If you please," Rosemary replied coldly.</p>

<p>"The children, as you are pleased to call them," Naniescu went
on with slow deliberation, shedding his affected manner as a
useless garment no longer required to conceal his thoughts, "the
children have done us an infinity of mischief, in the eyes of the
British and American public, by the publication of articles
defamatory to our Government; for this they have deserved
punishment. Now, I propose to remit that punishment if you will
undo the mischief that they have done."</p>

<p>"I?" Rosemary exclaimed, puzzled. "How?"</p>

<p>"By publishing newspaper articles that will refute those
calumnies once and for all," the general said blandly. Then, as
Rosemary recoiled at the suggestion as if she had been struck in
the face, he went on cynically: "You are such a brilliant
journalist, dear lady, endowed with a vivid imagination. It will be
easy for you to do this for the sake of those two young traitors in
whom you take such a kindly interest. You may, in your articles,
begin by stating the truth, if you like, and say that my Government
invited you to come over to Transylvania in order to investigate
the alleged acts of tyranny that are supposed to be perpetrated
against the minority nationals. Then you will proceed to state that
after impartial and exhaustive inquiry you have come to the
conclusion that practically all the charges brought against us are
unfounded, that with the exception of a few inevitable hardships
consequent of foreign occupation, the minority nationals in
Transylvania are enjoying the utmost freedom and security under the
just laws of an enlightened country. You will—"</p>

<p>But here the flow of the worthy general's eloquence received a
sudden check in the shape of a rippling outburst of laughter from
Rosemary. He frowned; not understanding her mood, his knowledge of
women being superficial, his thoughts flew to hysteria. He had
known a woman once—</p>

<p>As a matter of fact there was something hysterical about
Rosemary's laughter. She checked it as soon as she regained control
over herself. It was as well that she could laugh, that her sense
of humour, never absent in an Englishwoman of intellect, had at
once shown her the folly of giving way to the indignation which had
been her first impulse. Frankly she could not see herself as an
outraged tragedy queen thundering forth an emphatic "Never!" to the
Roumanian's impudent proposals; and when Naniescu marvelled at the
strange moods of women and vainly tried to guess what there was in
the present situation to make this pretty woman laugh, he little
knew that Rosemary was laughing at an imaginary picture of herself,
with head thrown back and flaming eyes, and gestures that rivalled
those of the general himself in their elegant and expressive
sweep.</p>

<p>"You must forgive me, Monsieur le General," she said presently,
"but your proposition is so funny!"</p>

<p>"Funny, dear lady!" he protested. "Frankly I do not
see—"</p>

<p>"No," she broke in, "you would not."</p>

<p>"Will you be so gracious as to explain?"</p>

<p>"No," Rosemary went on lightly, "I don't think I will. You would
not understand—even then."</p>

<p>"Then," he said coolly, "there is nothing left for me to do but
to take my leave, and to deplore that you should have wasted so
much of your valuable time in conversation with a clod."</p>

<p>He rose, and bowing low, he put out his hand in order to take
hers, but Rosemary did not move.</p>

<p>"You cannot go, Monsieur le General," she said firmly, "without
giving me a definite answer."</p>

<p>"I have given you a definite answer, dear lady. It is my
misfortune that you choose to treat it as ludicrous."</p>

<p>"But surely you were not serious when you suggested—"</p>

<p>"When I suggested that the mischief wrought by two traitors
should be remedied by one who takes an interest in them? What could
be more serious?"</p>

<p>"You seriously think," she insisted, "that I would lend myself
to such traffic? that I would put my name to statements which I
could not verify, or to others that I should actually believe to be
false? <i>Ah ça</i>, Monsieur le General, where did you get your
conception of English women of letters, or of English
journalists?"</p>

<p>Naniescu put his finger-tips to his breast, then spread out his
hands with a broad gesture of protest.</p>

<p>"I was wrong," he said suavely, "utterly wrong. I admit it.
Forgive me, and permit me to take my leave—"</p>

<p>"Monsieur le General—"</p>

<p>"At your service, dear lady."</p>

<p>"Young Imrey," she pleaded, "and Anna Heves!"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I am truly sorry for them," he said unctuously; "but surely you
do not think seriously that I would lend myself to any traffic
where the safety of my country is concerned. <i>Ah ça</i>, dear
lady," he went on, not only mocking the very words she had used,
but even the inflexion of her voice. "Where did you get your
conception of a Roumanian officer or of a Roumanian gentleman?"</p>

<p>"It is you who proposed an infamous traffic," she retorted, "not
I."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," he protested. "All that I suggested was that the
mischief done should be remedied in the simplest way, before those
who had wrought it could hope for pardon. The mischief was done
through the public Press; it can only be made good through the
public Press, and only through the medium of one as influential as
yourself. My suggestion has not met with your approval. Let us say
no more about it."</p>

<p>Before she could prevent it he had taken her hand and raised it
to his lips. She snatched it away as if her finger-tips had come in
contact with something noxious; the indignation which she had tried
so hard to keep under control flamed for an instant out of her
eyes; and Naniescu, seeing it, gave a soft, guttural laugh.</p>

<p>"I had a suspicion," he said cynically, "that the situation was
not entirely ludicrous. And now," he went on, "have I your
permission to take my leave?"</p>

<p>He bowed once more, hand on breast, heels clicking, and was on
the point of turning to go when an impulsive cry from Rosemary
brought him to a halt.</p>

<p>"That is not your last word, General Naniescu?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," he replied with utmost gallantry, "but the last word
rests with you, dear lady. I am ever at your service. Only," he
continued very slowly and very deliberately, "let me assure you
once and for all that young Imrey and Anna Heves will appear before
the military courts on a charge of treason unless a series of
articles written in the spirit I have had the honour to outline
before you, and bearing your distinguished name, appear
in—shall we say <i>The Times</i>?—within the next
month. But, just to show you how greatly I value your regard, I
will be as lenient as my duty permits. I will even allow those two
young traitors to return, temporarily, to their homes. Philip Imrey
and Anna Heves will be brought here in the course of a day or two.
They will be free, within certain limitations, to move about among
their friends. I need not add, dear lady, that you, on the other
hand, are absolutely free, without any limitations, to come and go
as you choose. On the day that the last of your brilliant articles
will have appeared in The Times Imrey and his cousin will receive a
free pardon from the Government which they have outraged."</p>

<p>He paused a moment, then raised one hairy, manicured finger and
added with theatrical emphasis:</p>

<p>"But not before."</p>

<p>Rosemary had listened to his long speech without moving a
muscle. She stood straight as a sapling, looking unflinchingly at
the man, striving to shame him, yet knowing that in this she would
not succeed. There was no room for shame or compunction in that
bundle of conceit and depravity.</p>

<p>Fear, too, appeared to be one of the tortuous motives which had
suggested this ignominious "either-or." How far the Roumanian
Government was a party to the mishandling of Transylvania, Rosemary
had not yet had the opportunity of ascertaining.</p>

<p>She strongly suspected Naniescu of having over-stretched his
powers, and of dreading an exposure at Bucharest more, perhaps,
than in London or New York. Now, when he had finished speaking, and
while his mellow eyes still rested with gentle mockery upon her,
she could not keep back the final taunt which she hoped would sting
him as much as his urbanity had stung her.</p>

<p>"What proof have I," she queried slowly, "that if I fulfil my
share of the bargain you will not in the end repudiate yours?"</p>

<p>He smiled, quite undisturbed.</p>

<p>"You mistrust me. It is only natural," he said unctuously. "But
what can I do?"</p>

<p>"Write me a letter," she replied coldly, "embodying your terms
for the release of Philip Imrey and Anna Heves, and your promise to
keep to the bargain if I accept those terms."</p>

<p>"Will that satisfy you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It would hold you to your word, at any rate. For if it did
not—"</p>

<p>He gave his soft, throaty laugh, and a glimmer of satisfaction
shot through his eyes.</p>

<p>"You Englishwomen are truly marvellous," he observed. "So
business-like. Everything in black and white—what?"</p>

<p>"Preferably," she rejoined drily.</p>

<p>"Well, then, you shall have the letter, dear lady," he concluded
blandly. "And I promise you that I shall so tie myself down to my
share of this interesting transaction that you will not hesitate
any longer to fulfil yours."</p>

<p>And the next moment, even while Rosemary turned towards the
window in order to look for one brief moment, at any rate, on
something clean and pure, Naniescu had gone, softly closing the
door behind him and leaving in his wake a faint odour of Havana
cigar and eau de Cologne, and an atmosphere of intrigue which
Rosemary felt to be stifling. She threw open the window and inhaled
the clean air right down into her lungs. Her thoughts were still in
a whirl. The situation was so impossible that her brain at present
rejected it. It could not be. Things like this did not occur. It
was not modern. Not twentieth century. Not post-war. Civilized men
and women did not have interviews such as she had just had with
this smooth-tongued Roumanian. There was something medieval about
this "either-or," this impasse to which in very truth there was no
issue.</p>

<p>Rosemary now started pacing up and down the room. She was alone
and could indulge in this time-tried method of soothing jangled
nerves. With both forefingers she tapped her temples, as if to
stimulate the work of a jaded brain. Issue? There must be an issue
to this impasse. She was a British subject, the wife of an English
peer. She could not be bullied into doing things against which her
sense of honour rebelled. She could not be made to lend her name to
falsehoods, knowing them to be falsehoods. Of course not. Of course
not. She could not be compelled. That was a fact. An undisputable,
hard, solid fact. What then? Well, then there were Philip and Anna,
who would be brought before the military courts on a charge of
treason. And the military courts would condemn them—to what?
To death? No! No! No! Not to death! Philip and little Anna:
children whom she knew and loved! Condemned to death! Shot! like
Edith Cavell, or Captain Fryatt! Shot! But that was in war time!
Now the world was at peace! The Treaty of Versailles was the
millennium that would bring peace on earth, goodwill toward men!
Peace! This was peace! Foolish, thoughtless children could not in
peace time be shot as traitors!</p>

<p>Tap-tap went Rosemary's fingers against her temples. Peace, ye
gods! Philip and Anna had rendered themselves liable to human
justice, and human justice in this half-forgotten corner of God's
earth knew but one law—revenge! Philip and Anna would be
condemned—and shot, unless she, Rosemary Tarkington, gained a
free pardon for them at the price of truth, honour and the welfare,
perhaps, of thousands of innocents.</p>

<p>And as gradually this awful alternative penetrated into the
innermost recesses of her brain, the girl looked wildly about her
like an animal suddenly fallen into a trap. Her knees all at once
gave way under her, and she fell up against the sofa, with arms
outspread upon the cushions. With head thrown back, she gazed
unseeing up at the ceiling, and this time it was a real hysterical
outburst that caused her to laugh and to laugh, until laughter
broke into a sob, and burying her face in her hands she burst into
a flood of tears.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 14</h2>

<p>Rosemary, being very human and very young, felt all the better
after she had had a good cry. Better mentally, that is to say.
Physically she was tired, hot, overstrained; her eyes ached, her
limbs ached, her head ached, but mentally she felt better.</p>

<p>Presently she struggled back to her feet, dabbed her eyes with
cold water, put powder on her nose and a comb through her hair. She
did not want to look a sight when presently Jasper came back from
his walk and she told him all that had happened.</p>

<p>By the way, where was Jasper?</p>

<p>Rosemary was just aching to review the whole situation with him.
No need now for secrecy with regard to Philip and little Anna's
foolish conspiracy. Soon the whole world would know of it, friend
and foe alike. And Jasper would be able to help, of course, or at
any rate to advise. He had done so much for the Roumanian
Government in the past, there was just a chance they might do
something at his request—out of gratitude.</p>

<p>Gratitude? Rosemary smiled ironically to herself at thought of
connecting so gentle an emotion with men like Naniescu. Still,
Jasper might think of something, of some way out of the situation,
which Rosemary still persisted in thinking unreal. It was, of
course, the climax of a plan formed as far back as the Five Arts'
Ball at the Albert Hall, when Naniescu first proposed to her that
she should come to Transylvania. To get her here, then to close on
Philip and Anna a trap which had no doubt long ago been set, and
finally to use them as a lever in order to force her, Rosemary, to
write those articles which would sooth the vanity of Roumanian
bureaucrats and throw dust in the eyes of the sentimental
public.</p>

<p>As if in response to Rosemary's wish for his presence, Jasper
presently walked in, courteous, chivalrous, full of apologies for
having left her to face Naniescu alone.</p>

<p>"I must have been dreaming," he said contritely, "while I
wandered out of the park, for, all of a sudden, I found myself away
upon the mountain-side, thinking of you. Your dear face peeped at
me through the trees, and then I realized that I was leaving you in
the lurch, and that you might be wanting me—and I not there!
Can you, I wonder, forgive me?"</p>

<p>He sat down beside her on the sofa and took her hand, and one by
one he kissed each rosy finger-tip.</p>

<p>"Wherever I am, little one," he said softly, "I always see you.
Your presence beside me this morning was so real that I was never
wholly conscious that you were not actually there. Will you forgive
me?" he asked again.</p>

<p>Rosemary turned to him with a smile. There was no one in the
world quite so kind as Jasper; his kind, grave eyes were fixed on
her with such a look of adoration that instinctively Rosemary
nestled closer to him like a trusting child, and on an impulse she
told him everything: the arrest of Philip Imrey and of little Anna,
and Naniescu, and his mind appeared to wander, as if he were
thinking of something else, and Rosemary harkened in vain for a
word of indignation from him when she told him about Naniescu's
abominable "either-or." Yet she studied his face very closely,
those fine aristocratic features with their somewhat affected
wearied expression, and the dark eyes set closely together like
those of an eagle or a hawk. He said nothing. He only looked as if
he were thinking hard. Pondering over something that puzzled and
worried him. Rosemary wondered what it was. And later on, when she
pressed him with questions, he seemed to drag himself back to the
present situation with a great effort of nerve and will, and even
then he did not appear to have a firm grasp of it. He put
irrelevant counter-questions, and once or twice answered at random.
His chief concern seemed to be that she, Rosemary, knowing the
foolish game Philip and Anna were playing, had not succeeded in
putting a stop to it.</p>

<p>"The girl appeared sensible enough," he said almost irritably.
"I believe she would have listened to you. That sort of thing is
just romantic nonsense. It never does any good, and more often than
not it brings trouble on the innocent rather than on the guilty.
The same thing applies to the Germans, the Austrians and to the
Hungarians. They have been beaten and they have got to take their
punishment. All these political intrigues are just folly!"</p>

<p>Of course Jasper was right. Of course he was sensible, and just
and clear-thinking. But while Rosemary paid ungrudging tribute to
his judgement, she felt more and more chilled by his total lack not
only of sympathy but even of attention, as if the matter of Philip
and Anna's life and liberty hardly interested him. Now Rosemary
hardly liked to ask him for advice, for fear he might tell her to
assent to Naniescu's wish—and to write those articles against
which her sense of right and wrong, of truth and professional
honour rebelled.</p>

<p>She could almost hear Jasper saying:</p>

<p>"You can get quite near the truth in your articles and satisfy
Naniescu and you will save those two hotheads from the consequences
of their own indiscretion. Believe me you would be doing far more
good that way to this miserable country than Philip ever did with
his ill-considered articles."</p>

<p>Perhaps Jasper had actually said all this. Rosemary could not be
sure. For the last few minutes her mind had been absent from her
body. It had flown over mountains and seas, right across the great
plains of Hungary and the fields of waving corn, to a small, dark
corner in the crowded Albert Hall, with noisy jazz music buzzing in
the distance like phantom melodies, with laughter and chatter all
around, glittering jewels, fantastic clothes and waving fans; and
here Rosemary's mind came to a halt and insistently beckoned to
memory. She recalled every moment of that night, every incident
stood out like a picture before her now: the dance with Peter, and
then the box with the heavy curtains that shut her right out of the
world—alone with Peter. She recalled every line of his face,
those fine white hands made to wield brush or pen rather than a
cricket-ball, the fair, curly head, the tense dark eyes.</p>

<p>What sympathy she would have got from Peter if only he were
here! His judgement, perhaps, would not have been so sound as
Jasper's: Rosemary would not feel that she could rely on Peter to
say or do only what was right, what was just and reasonable. He
would be guided by his heart and not by his head; he would be
wrong, no doubt—utterly wrong—in his judgements, in his
advice. But oh! he would be so human, so full of pity, so
understanding! And for the first time since her marriage to Jasper,
Rosemary allowed herself to think of Peter, to long for Peter, to
mourn that which Peter had meant in her life: youth, humanity and
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>And suddenly she was brought back to Kis-Imre and to the reality
of the present situation by a direct question put to her by
Jasper:</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me, dear, that Peter Blakeney was in
Transylvania?"</p>

<p>Jasper had put the question quite gently and kindly. He never
put on with Rosemary any airs of martial authority, nor was there
even a hint of reproach in his tone. But the question did bring
Rosemary's mind back in a second from the Albert Hall to Kis-Imre.
She frowned, very much puzzled, and turned to look straight at
Jasper. He, too, appeared to have come back to Kis-Imre from the
land of nowhere. He still had on a puzzled and pondering
expression, but with it a certain look of hardness, which he seldom
had when his wife was nigh.</p>

<p>"Peter Blakeney?" Rosemary asked slowly. "What in the world do
you mean?"</p>

<p>"Don't look so scared, little one," Jasper rejoined, his stern
face breaking into a smile. "As a matter of fact the whole thing
has puzzled me to such an extend that I am afraid I must have
appeared very unresponsive just now—" He paused, and, leaning
forward, he rested his elbows on his knees, and instead of looking
as if he wished to avoid making her feel uncomfortable by staring
directly at her.</p>

<p>"A moment ago," he resumed presently, "as I was crossing the
hall, General Naniescu came out of the smoking-room into the outer
vestibule. He did not see me, and I was just debating in my mind
whether I would speak to him when he turned to a young officer who
was evidently in attendance, and what he said to him was this:
'Ring up Mr. Blakeney at once and tell him I will see him about the
business at five o'clock his afternoon; you may tell him that on
the whole I think I have been successful."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" Rosemary exclaimed impulsively.</p>

<p>"So I thought at the time," Jasper rejoined. "Therefore I
recrossed the hall and spoke a few words to Naniescu. He appeared
vexed when he saw me, and I distinctly saw him make a sign to the
officer, who did not then go to the telephone, although a moment
ago Naniescu had ordered him to ring up at once. I kept the general
talking for a few minutes in the hall. He did not refer to his
conversation with you, nor did he refer in any way to Peter."</p>

<p>"You must have misunderstood the name," Rosemary insisted.</p>

<p>"I thought so at first, but I had confirmation of it later on.
Naniescu very obviously and very clumsily maneuvered me toward the
dining-room, the doors of which were wide open. As soon as he had
got me into the room he closed the doors. Now, I happened to have
very sharp ears, and although Naniescu talked to me at the top of
his voice I distinctly heard what was going on in the hall. The
officer called up the Hotel New York at Cluj, after which there was
a pause. I tried to take my leave of the general, for I wanted to
come up to you, but he would not let me go. He talked incessantly
and always at the top of his voice on all sorts of irrelevant
topics. He dragged me to the window at the farther end of the room
to show me the view. He tried to persuade me to go out with him for
a turn in the park. Finally fortune favoured me; my sharp ears
caught the ring of the telephone bell. I gave Naniescu the slip and
just had the door open when I heard the officer say quite
distinctly in French:</p>

<p>"'Is that you, Mr. Blakeney? Mr. Blakeney, his Excellency will
see you—' At this point," Jasper went on, "Naniescu with a
loud guffaw took hold of my arm and made some facetious remark
which I did not catch. However, he had made it so obvious that he
did not wish me to hear the telephone message, and, on the other
hand, I had heard the officer name Peter so distinctly that I
allowed myself to be dragged back into the room, and made no
further attempt to pry into Naniescu's—or
Peter's—secrets."</p>

<p>"But this is all nonsense," Rosemary broke in warmly. "Peter is
not in Transylvania. I am sure he is not. He would have told me. He
would have let me know. It is some other Blakeney whom Naniescu was
calling up."</p>

<p>Jasper shrugged. "Perhaps," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"I am sure," Rosemary insisted.</p>

<p>Jasper said nothing more after that, and Rosemary was conscious
of a feeling of irritation against him because he was so obviously
convinced that Peter was in Transylvania and in secret
communication with that odious Naniescu. How could he imagine such
a thing? Peter! Peter with the lovely Hungarian mother! Peter?
Nonsense! But Rosemary could not sit still. She jumped to her feet
and began fidgeting about the room, arranging her dress, her hair,
fidgeting, fidgeting. She would not look at Jasper, and she was
determined not to say anything more. He would discover his mistake
soon enough, and if she said anything now she might use words,
phrases, expression which later on she would regret.</p>

<p>Peter intriguing with a Roumanian! Nonsense! And yet her nerves
were terribly on edge, more so now than they were after her
interview with Naniescu. And she could not bear to look at Jasper.
She was afraid that she would hate him for his thoughts about
Peter. Fortunately after a little while the luncheon-bell sounded.
Jasper jumped to his feet. He too seemed relieved that the subject
of Peter could now be conveniently dropped.</p>

<p>"Will you see Elza?" he said abruptly.</p>

<p>"Elza?" Rosemary asked. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Naniescu and his suite are in the house," Jasper replied drily.
"They will stay to lunch. I don't know what Elza will feel about
it."</p>

<p>"She will feel as I do," Rosemary retorted hotly, "that the
man's presence at her table is an outrage."</p>

<p>"But he told me that Philip and Anna will be allowed to come
home."</p>

<p>"Yes. Provisionally. Until I—"</p>

<p>"Elza need not know about that," Jasper broke in hurriedly.
"That is why I thought you would see her. She need not know that
Philip's release is only—conditional—"</p>

<p>Rosemary thought the matter over for a moment. As always, Jasper
was right. Elza need not know. Not yet.</p>

<p>"Shall I go to her now," she said, "and tell her?"</p>

<p>"I think it would come best from you. It will be such news for
her, poor thing."</p>

<p>"Poor darling!" Rosemary sighed; then she added more coldly:
"But what about me?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Am I expected to sit at table with that mealy-mouthed
Roumanian?"</p>

<p>Jasper smiled. "How else would you explain the situation to
Elza?" he asked.</p>

<p>All this had brought about a fresh train of thought, and
Rosemary was quite thankful that Jasper was showing such sympathy
for Elza. He was quite right. Elza need not be told that the
release of Philip and Anna was only conditional. There was a month
still ahead before Elza need be told the truth.</p>

<p>"Will you keep Naniescu talking," Rosemary said finally, "while
I see Elza?"</p>

<p>She looked quite cool and self-possessed now, beautifully
dressed, one row of perfect pearls round her neck, circles of
diamonds in her ears, a great lady conscious of her own beauty.
"How wonderful you are!" came as an involuntary exclamation from
her husband's lips, and his dark, deep-set eyes lit up with a
sudden flash of passionate admiration as they rested on the vision
of loveliness before him.</p>

<p>Then together they went out of the room, Rosemary just a step of
two in front of her husband. She still could not bear to look at
him, and when she caught his look of bold admiration she coldly
turned her head away. Obedient to her wish, he went downstairs to
keep Naniescu talking, while she went to break the good news to
Elza. But walking along the stately gallery that led to her
hostess's rooms, Rosemary's thoughts were not with Elza, her lips
were murmuring almost audibly:</p>

<p>Peter intriguing with a Roumanian?</p>

<p>What nonsense!</p>

<p>Jasper must be mad!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 15</h2>

<p>The moment that Rosemary came into the room she guessed that
Elza somehow or other had heard the news. She had tears in her big,
kind eyes, but they were tears of emotion, not of sorrow or
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Philip is coming home with Anna!" she cried as soon as she
caught sight of Rosemary.</p>

<p>"Who told you?" Rosemary asked.</p>

<p>"General Naniescu sent his captain to tell me. I only knew it
five minutes ago. But oh, my dear, they have been such five
minutes!"</p>

<p>Rosemary kissed her with tender affection. She did not feel
somehow as if she could say much.</p>

<p>"Isn't it wonderful?" Elza went on while she put a few finishing
touches to her toilet. "And has not Naniescu been kind? Of course I
knew that they could not do anything to Philip because he has done
nothing, and I don't believe that Anna did anything either. But you
know, my dear, these days some awful mistakes do occur. But," she
added lightly, "I have so often experienced it in life that men are
not nearly so cruel as they are credited to be. One is so apt to
pass judgement on insufficient evidence. Give a man the chance of
doing a kind act, that is my motto, and he will nearly always do
it."</p>

<p>Fortunately Elza was rather fussy for the moment, fidgeting
about the room and obviously trying to calm her nerves, so she did
not notice Rosemary's silent, unresponsive way.</p>

<p>"When do you expect Philip and Anna?" Rosemary said at last.</p>

<p>"This afternoon," Elza exclaimed, her words rang out like a
little cry of joy. "And you know Maurus is so happy that he has
actually gone down in order to say something civil to Naniescu,
who, of course, is staying for lunch. Well," she added after a
moment or two, when she had gathered up her keys, her rings, her
handkerchief, and given a final tap to her hair, "shall we go down
too?"</p>

<p>Without a word Rosemary followed her. She felt as if she must
choke. Elza's happiness was going to be the most severe trial of
all during this terrible month that lay ahead of her.</p>

<p>"Oh, and I was almost forgetting," Elza resumed, while she
tripped lightly along the gallery towards the stairs, "the smaller
joy beside the greater—the greatest one! I have heard from
Peter Blakeney."</p>

<p>"From Peter?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He is at Cluj, at the New York. He is over here about some
arrangement he wants to make for a cricket match or something silly
of that sort—you know what Peter is: quite mad about that
silly cricket. I had a letter from him this morning, but when it
came I had no thought for anything except Philip. I must let you
read it presently. I don't really know what he says, but if he is
at Cluj we are sure to see him very soon."</p>

<p>She prattled on as merry as a bird. She seemed twenty years
younger all of a sudden—her step was light and springy, her
eyes were bright, her voice was fresh and clear. Rosemary kept on
repeating to herself:</p>

<p>"She need not know for at least three weeks. She need not know,
and I must pretend—pretend—at any cost. She will know
soon enough, poor darling."</p>

<p>And Rosemary did manage to pretend; for the next three hours she
was just an automaton, wound up to play a certain part. To everyone
she had to pretend—to Elza, to Maurus, to that odious
Naniescu, and even to Jasper. The worst of all was pretending to
Jasper, for from this she got no reprieve. Jasper's kind, anxious
eyes were on her all the time, but she would not let him see that
she was anxious about Peter. Somehow the episode about Peter had
made everything so much worse. Not that she harboured the thought
for a moment that Peter was intriguing with Naniescu. That, of
course, was out of the question. He had come to arrange something
about a cricket match, and, of course, he had to see Naniescu about
it, get his permission, and so on. There were ten chances to one
that Peter had written to her and told her all about it, and that
his letter had gone astray. No, no, no! There could be no thought
of an intrigue between Peter and these Roumanians; but Rosemary
felt that Jasper thought there was, and was vaguely pitying her
because of some unknown treachery on Peter's part. It was
odious!</p>

<p>And with it all Elza's obvious happiness was almost intolerable
to witness, and even Maurus departed from his habitual ill-temper
to exchange facetious remarks with Naniescu. Time seemed
leaden-footed. The interminable luncheon dragged on wearily, as did
the hour of coffee and liqueurs, of endless small talk and constant
pretence. But even the worst moments in life must become things of
the past sooner or later, and when Rosemary began to feel that she
could not stand the whole thing any longer, she found that Naniescu
and his officers were actually taking their leave.</p>

<p>After luncheon Jasper was quite charming. He had thought the
whole matter over, he said, and decided that it was in his power to
make a personal appeal to the King in favour of Philip and Anna. He
had certainly rendered more than one signal service to Roumania
during and after the war, and he thought that in these countries
personal influence counted a great deal. At any rate, there would
be no harm in trying, and he would start for Bucharest immediately.
He had spoken about the proposed journey to Elza and Maurus,
alleging official business, and Elza had already arranged that he
should be driven into Cluj in time for the afternoon express.
Rosemary's heart was at once filled with gratitude; she felt angry
with herself for having mistrusted him. She threw herself
whole-heartedly into the preparations for his journey, lolled her
troubled soul with the belief that it would prove to be the happy
issue out of this terrible situation. When it was time for him to
go she wished him God-speed with more fervour and affection than
she had shown him for days.</p>

<p>"Bar accidents," he assured her, "I shall be back in a
fortnight. If I have definite good news to report I will wire. But
even if you don't hear from me, I shall be back, as I say, in
fifteen days."</p>

<p>"I shall count the hours until your return," she said.</p>

<p>"And in the meanwhile," he urged with deep earnestness, "you
will do nothing without consulting me."</p>

<p>She smiled at this want of logic, so unlike her methodical
husband.</p>

<p>"I could not consult you, dear," she said. "You won't be
here."</p>

<p>"No, no, I know," he insisted; "but I want you to promise that
you will leave things as they are until my return. I don't want you
to give anything away to Elza, or to Philip or Anna. Promise
me."</p>

<p>"Of course I'll promise," replied readily. "God knows I don't
want to be the one to break the awful news to them."</p>

<p>"Or to Peter," he added gravely.</p>

<p>"Peter?"</p>

<p>"I want you to promise me—to promise, Rosemary, that you
will not speak of this miserable affair to Peter Blakeney."</p>

<p>Then, as she seemed to hesitate, vaguely puzzled at his
desperate earnestness, he again insisted:</p>

<p>"Promise me, Rosemary, whatever you may hear, whatever you may
see, whatever may be planned by Elza or anybody else, promise me
that you will not speak of it to Peter."</p>

<p>"But Jasper," she exclaimed, "why? Of course I will promise, if
you wish it, but frankly I don't understand why you insist, so
solemnly too," she added, trying to assume a lightness of heart
which she was far from feeling. Then she went on more gravely: "I
could trust Peter as I would myself."</p>

<p>"You can put it down to nerves," Jasper said, with the ghost of
a smile, "to intuition or foreboding, or merely to jealousy and my
wretched character, to anything you please, my dear one. But
promise me! Promise me that everything in connexion with this
miserable affair will remain just between you and me. Let the
others talk, guess, plan. Promise me that you will never speak of
it with Peter. Promise me, or I will throw up the sponge, remain
here to look after you, and let Naniescu do his worst with the lot
of them."</p>

<p>Thus, alternately demanding, entreating, threatening, he
extracted the promise from her, even though her heart cried out
against what she felt was treachery to Peter. Jasper's insistence
filled her with a vague sense of foreboding not unmixed with fear;
and yet, the very next moment, as soon as he had her promise, he
became tender, soft, loving, as if trying to make her forget his
solemn earnestness of a while ago. He took her in his arms and
gazed into her eyes with an intensity of longing which made her own
heart ache with self-reproach.</p>

<p>"If God there be," he whispered softly, as if to himself, "it
was cruel of Him to make you so beautiful—and so
desirable."</p>

<p>Again his mood had changed. Tenderness had turned into passion,
fierce, almost primeval, and he held her now more like a man
defending the greatest treasure he possessed on God's earth than
like a husband taking affectionate leave of his wife.</p>

<p>"If I should lose you, Rosemary," he murmured, "because of
this."</p>

<p>She tried to laugh and to speak flippantly. "Lose me?" she said.
"You have little chance of doing that, my dear, for this or any
other cause. Naniescu has not the power of life and death over me,"
she added more seriously.</p>

<p>There was something about Jasper at this moment that she could
not entirely fathom. Twice before she had seen him in these moods
of violent passion akin almost to savagery, when she felt utterly
helpless and absolutely in his power. She had the feeling that when
he was in one of these moods he was capable of any violence against
her if she dared to disobey or resist. Not that Rosemary was
afraid; she had never in her life been afraid of anyone; but she
had always been mistress of herself, and at this moment, held
tightly by the man to whom she had sworn love and fealty, she felt
like a slave of olden times in the grip of her lord.</p>

<p>"You—you will care for me some day, Rosemary?" he asked
with passionate earnestness. "Say that you will some day, when all
this—all this is forgotten, and we are back again in England,
free to live our own lives, free to love. You will care for me
then, Rosemary, will you not? For I could not live beside you for
long, feeling all the time that you did not belong to me with your
whole soul. You have such haunting eyes—eyes such as pixies
and fairies have—maddening eyes. I should go crazy presently
if I failed to kindle the love-light in those eyes."</p>

<p>He kissed her eyes, her mouth, her throat. Rosemary would have
struggled, would have screamed if she dared. Fortunately a knock at
the door and the entrance of one of the menservants, who came to
fetch milord's luggage, put an end to a situation which Rosemary
found very difficult to endure. After the man had gone the spell
appeared to be broken. Jasper became once more the courteous, grave
man of the world he had always been. The episode of a moment ago
did not seem to have occurred at all, as far as he was concerned,
and while Rosemary felt her teeth chattering and the palms of her
hands were covered with a cold sweat, Jasper moved about the room
and spoke to her about his proposed journey, his certain return in
a fortnight, as if nothing had happened.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 16</h2>

<p>The carriage which took Jasper to Cluj brought back Philip and
Anna. After that the house was full of animation, like a beehive in
May. Rosemary only saw the two young people for a moment. She felt
a stranger in this family gathering, and her heart was so heavy
that she soon found a pretext for going up to her room. Later on
she pleaded a headache. Kind and hospitable as were these dear
people, Rosemary felt that they must wish to be alone amongst
themselves after the terrible time they had all gone through. They
would have so much to talk over that the presence of a stranger,
even so welcome as one as Rosemary Tarkington, must of necessity be
irksome. It was clear to her from the first that Philip and Anna
knew little, if anything, of the conditions attached to their
release. Philip talked lightly of their being under surveillance
for a time, and then added quite gaily that he would gladly lead
the life of a hermit in Kis-Imre and never go outside the gates
until the present clouds blew over. He gave himself up wholly to
the joy of watching his mother's happiness and seeing her dear eyes
beaming on her returned boy. Altogether he was more like a
schoolboy who by a fluke has escaped punishment than a man
conscious of a deadly peril that had not ceased to threaten
him.</p>

<p>They all sat up talking late into the evening, and when Rosemary
found herself at last alone in her room, trying to think things out
before she went to bed, little Anna came up to her. The child
looked hollow-eyed and grave; the joy that had been on her face
when she first found herself in this second home of hers had all
gone. She looked old, wan and tired out.</p>

<p>Rosemary put out her arms, and Anna ran up to her and snuggled
up close to her, just like a child. For a long time she was quite
silent, with her head against her friend's shoulder, her little
thin hands held in Rosemary's kind, firm grasp. Now and again a hot
tear would fall on Rosemary's hands. Anna was crying quietly to
herself, and Rosemary waited until the girl was calm enough to
speak.</p>

<p>"I don't understand the whole thing, Rosemary," were the first
words that Anna spoke.</p>

<p>"What is it you don't understand, dear?" Rosemary asked.</p>

<p>"It is not like them to be lenient, is it?" the girl retorted,
looking up with quick, eager inquiry into her friend's face.</p>

<p>"Oh, in this case," Rosemary rejoined vaguely, "you are both so
young!"</p>

<p>Anna shook her head vigorously.</p>

<p>"That wouldn't worry them," she said, "after all the trouble
they must have taken to track us down."</p>

<p>"You were caught in the act, I suppose?" Rosemary queried.</p>

<p>Anna nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "And that was strange too. I had all my parcels
ready—the usual ones for Budapest, and Philip's manuscript at
the bottom of a box of vegetable seeds. Half a dozen soldiers and
an officer came into the shop and walked straight up to the place
where the parcels were stacked. They seemed to know all about
everything, for the officer just ordered his men to undo all the
parcels, and, of course, there was Philip's manuscript."</p>

<p>"There is nothing strange in all that, Anna," Rosemary said. "I
have no doubt in my mind that you both have been watched for some
time by secret service men, and at last they closed their trap on
you."</p>

<p>But once more Anna shook her head.</p>

<p>"I can't explain what I mean," she said, and puckered her fine
straight brows together. "It is a kind of intuition that came to me
when I saw those soldiers walk in. I am absolutely convinced that
we were not denounced by regular Government spies. They are too
clumsy, and we were too careful. I am certain," she reiterated
obstinately, "that we were not denounced by one of them."</p>

<p>"By whom, then?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that I don't know. It is an awful feeling I have. You know
I never believed in all that so-called psychic nonsense which is so
fashionable just now, but the feeling I have is not just an
ordinary one. It is so strong that I cannot fight against it. It is
a feeling that eyes—eyes—are always watching me and
Philip—cruel eyes—eyes that wish us evil—that
will us to do something foolish, unconsidered, something that will
get us again into trouble, and for good this time."</p>

<p>"You are overwrought, Anna dear," Rosemary put in gently. "And
no wonder! Of course, we all know that there are Government spies
all over the place, and you and Philip will have to be doubly
careful in the future' but here in Kis-Imre you are among friends.
Your aunt Elza's servants are all of them Hungarian and thoroughly
to be trusted."</p>

<p>Anna said nothing. She was staring straight out in front of her,
as if trying to meet those mysterious eyes which were for ever
watching her. An involuntary cry of horror rose to Rosemary's
lips.</p>

<p>"Anna!" she exclaimed, "you don't think that I—"</p>

<p>But before she could complete her sentence Anna's arms were
round her.</p>

<p>"Of course not. Of course not," the girl murmured tenderly.
"Rosemary darling, of course not!"</p>

<p>"I never spoke about your affairs to a single soul, Anna,"
Rosemary said gravely. "I give you my solemn word of honour that I
never even mentioned the thing to my husband until after your
arrest, when, of course, all the facts became public property."</p>

<p>"I know, Rosemary, I know," Anna repeated. "I would trust you
with every secret. I would trust you with my life—with
Philip's life."</p>

<p>"And you did not trust anyone else?" Rosemary asked.</p>

<p>"I never breathed a word about it to a living soul, except to
you and Peter Blakeney."</p>

<p>"Peter knew?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Peter knew."</p>

<p>"You wrote to him?" Rosemary insisted. "Ah, then I understand.
Your letters were held up by the censor, and—"</p>

<p>"No, I never wrote to Peter what Philip and I were doing; but
you know he arrived in Cluj the day before I was arrested. He came
to arrange some cricket match or other between Roumanians and
Hungarians. I don't know anything about cricket, but, of course,
Peter was full of it. He came to see me at my lodgings quite
unexpectedly. I was so surprised to see him, and so happy, as I am
very, very fond of Peter. We talked till late into the evening, and
somehow I had to tell him everything. But except for that one talk
with Peter, and the one I had with you, I never breathed a word
about what Philip and I were doing, not to a living soul!"</p>

<p>Rosemary said nothing for the moment. Indeed there was nothing
much that she could say. Little Anna had got hold of the idea that
some mysterious agency had been at work and brought about her and
Philip's arrest. But, after all, what did it matter? Professional
spies or insidious traitor? What difference did it make in the end?
Anna was frightened because she feared a fresh denunciation. She
did not know that her poor life was already forfeit, that she was
just a mouse whom the cat had allowed to run free for a moment or
two, and that she would be pounced upon again unless her friend
Rosemary whom she trusted with her whole soul, bought freedom and
life for her.</p>

<p>But it was not thoughts of Anna that sealed Rosemary's lips at
this moment and left her mute, motionless, like an insentient log,
with Anna's cold little hand held tightly in her own. Anna had not
spoken of her activities or her plans to anyone except to Peter.
And Jasper had extracted a promise from her, Rosemary, that she
would not speak of Philip's or Anna's affairs to Peter. What
connexion was there between Jasper's insistence and that other
awful thought which, strive as she might, would haunt Rosemary's
brain like a hideous ghoul risen out of hell? What mystery lurked
in the denunciation of these children, in their release, in the
alternative which Naniescu had placed before her? What hidden
powers were at work, threatening her with shame and the children
with death?</p>

<p>Rosemary felt stifled. Rising abruptly, she went to the window
and stepped out on the balcony. The moon was up, a honey-coloured,
waning moon that threw its cool, mysterious light on park-land and
lake and the distant pine forest beyond. Immediately below the
balcony a bed of tuberoses, with wax-like corollas that shimmered
white and spectral, sent their intoxicating odour through the balmy
air. And against the background of dense shrubberies a couple of
fireflies gleamed and darted aimlessly, ceaselessly, in and out of
the shadows. Rosemary, seeing them, was reminded of what Anna had
said just now—that eyes were for ever looking at her, cruel
eyes, eyes that were on the watch, spying, spying.</p>

<p>Suddenly she clapped her hand to her mouth, smothering a sharp
cry that had risen to her throat; and instinctively she stepped
back into the room and hastily closed the window.</p>

<p>"What is it, Rosemary darling?" Anna asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing, dearie, nothing," Rosemary replied quickly. "The smell
of those tuberoses made me feel queer. That's all."</p>

<p>She could not tell Anna that while she watched the fireflies,
and the air was so still, so still that not a blade of grass
shivered, and even the leaves of the aspen were at rest, she had
perceived a tremor amongst the laurel bushes and seen some of the
tall branches held back by a hand, each finger of which was
outlined by the silvery light of the moon. And above the hand she
had sensed a pair of eyes that were looking up at her.</p>

<p>She tried to talk lightly with Anna, to infuse into her some of
the buoyancy of mind which she was far from feeling herself. She
was sure that Anna had a vague consciousness of the danger that
hung over her and those she cared for; the only thing she could not
know was that her fate and theirs lay in the hands of the friend
whom she trusted. How would she—how would they all—bear
the knowledge when it came to them, as come it must? How would she,
Rosemary, face the reproach which, even if unspoken by them, would
haunt her to the end of her life: "You might have saved us, if you
would."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 17</h2>

<p>And it was that spectre which from that hour haunted Rosemary;
it would not allow her to rest at night; it dogged her steps by
day. When she walked in the park and the soft summer breeze stirred
the branches of Lombardy poplars or the stately plumes of maize,
ghostly voices would seem to be whispering all around her: "Life
and liberty for Philip and Anna! Life and liberty for those two
children who love and trust you, who know nothing of the fate that
hangs over them!" And when she was in the house at meals or in the
family circle, with Elza radiating happiness and even Maurus
unbending, with Philip almost feverishly gay and Anna thoughtful,
the eyes of all these kind, dear people whom she loved seemed full
of reproach to the one woman who could save them—if she
would.</p>

<p>Then Rosemary, unable to pretend any longer, would run up to her
room; and she—one of the most sane, most level-headed women
in this neurotic age—would throw herself on her knees and
pray to be taken out of it all. Oh! to be out of
it—underground—anywhere! Just to be out of it, not to
see those smiles, that happiness, that contentment which she knew
must presently end in a devastating catastrophe. To be out of it
when the time came—in a few weeks—days—hours!</p>

<p>Hour followed hour, dull and leaden-footed. And they were all so
happy at Kis-Imre! Suspecting nothing, knowing nothing, whilst
Rosemary felt her self-control slipping away from her day by day.
At times she felt as if she could not endure the situation and
longer, as if she must tell one of them. Tell Elza or Maurus, or
the children! Surely they should know! There comes a time when a
doctor, knowing that his patient cannot recover, is bound in all
humanity to tell him. Then surely it was Rosemary's duty to say to
them all: "You don't know! You have not guessed! But you are
doomed. Doomed! Philip and Anna to death! You Elza and Maurus to
worse than death—limitless sorrow. Now you are just living on
a volcano. In another few days—twenty, nineteen,
eighteen—the flames will break through, the earth will totter
under your feet, and everything you care for in the world will be
engulfed. You will perish. Yes, you! All of you! And then you will
know about me! How I might have saved you and did not. And you will
hate me as no woman has ever been hated before. And I shall go
forth into the vast wilderness which is called the world. And I,
too, shall perish of sorrow and endless regret!"</p>

<p>She had not again seen those mysterious eyes which that evening,
while little Anna was talking, had peered at her from behind the
laurel bushes; and she was far too sensible to dwell on what might
only, after all, have been the creation of overwrought nerves.</p>

<p>The time was drawing near for Jasper's return. "Fifteen days" he
had said; and she knew that, bar accidents, he would keep his word.
But she had no news of him, and after the first week she ceased to
expect any. She would not own, even to herself, that she had
already ceased to build hopes in that direction. Jasper had
promised to wire as soon as he heard anything definite, so in this
case no news was bad news. Dear, kind Jasper! he knew how miserably
anxious she was! He would not keep good news from her—not one
hour.</p>

<p>It was on the tenth day that Peter arrived at the castle. He had
announced his coming twenty-four hours previously, and in a moment
there was excitement from attic to cellar in the house. Everybody
seemed to be arranging something, planning something. Tennis
excursions, dancing! Peter was such a good dancer! They would have
the gipsies over from Bonczhida. That was the finest band in the
whole of Transylvania; and they would ask the Keletys over from
Hajdu and the Fejérs from Henger, and perhaps Aunt Charlotte could
be persuaded to come and bring Marie. There was some talk of
private theatricals, of tableaux, a tennis tournament, perhaps a
cricket match, English fashion. Peter was so clever at all that
sort of thing! Rosemary was consulted about the cricket match and
the tournament, for these were to be done on English lines! But the
dancing and the acting and the picnics, these were to be truly and
entirely Hungarian—pre-war Hungarian, the gayest, merriest
things darling Rosemary had ever seen.</p>

<p>How much she had looked forward to Peter's coming, Rosemary did
not know until after she had seen him. What hopes she had built on
his mere presence, on his nearness, she did not own to herself
until afterwards. He had not been in the house many hours before
she realized that he had changed. Not changed for the worse, of
course not—but changed.</p>

<p>He seemed younger, more boyish—more English in many ways.
At one time the Hungarian strain had been very conspicuous in
Peter—his tempestuous love-making, his alternating moods of
fatalism and rebellion had always reminded Rosemary of those
barbaric chieftains—his forbears about whom she loved to
read—who had been up and fought the Turks, while the rest of
Europe only trembled at thought of their approach.</p>

<p>But now Peter was much more like the conventional young English
athlete: not very loquacious, very placid, ashamed of showing
emotion or excitement, standing about for the most part with his
hands in his trousers pockets contemplating the toes of his boots,
and smoking innumerable cigarettes. He had not seemed like this at
first. He arrived in the late afternoon, and Rosemary was
downstairs in the paved courtyard when the carriage drove in
through the gates, with its four spanking greys shining with
lather, for the day had been very hot and the roads were dusty.
Peter was on the box, having dislodged the coachman, who sat beside
him, the groom being relegated to the cushioned seat of the
victoria.</p>

<p>There was such a halloing and a shouting, everyone screaming a
welcome, grooms rushing to hold the horses, the greys pawing and
champing and shorting, that Rosemary hardly saw Peter when he threw
the reins to the coachman, jumped down from the box, and was lost
in a forest of welcoming arms that hid him completely from
view.</p>

<p>It was only after dinner, when the whole company went out into
the garden to get a breath of air, that Rosemary found herself for
a few moments alone with him. It had been desperately hot indoors,
and the noise of all these dear people all talking and laughing at
the same time had been overpowering. Fortunately everyone thought
it would be lovely in the garden, and still laughing and chattering
they trooped out like a brood of chickens let out of a coop.
Rosemary had wandered on ahead of the others, and presently she
turned down the path that ran along the perennial border, now a
riot of colour and a tangle of late lilies, crimson pentstemons and
evening primroses.</p>

<p>Rosemary did not hear Peter coming. No one ever dressed for
dinner at Kis-Imre, and Peter had his tennis shoes on, and the
rubber soles made not the slightest sound upon the smooth gravel
path. She had stopped to look at a clump of tiger lilies, when
suddenly a wonderful sense of well-being seemed to descend upon her
soul. It was as if she had stepped out of a boat that had been
tossed about a stormy sea, and had all of a sudden set her foot
upon firm ground. The first words he said were so like the foolish,
lighthearted Peter she knew.</p>

<p>"You wonderful pixie!" he said, "I can't believe that it is
really you!"</p>

<p>She did not immediately turn to look at him, but went on
studying the markings on the lilies; then she said, as
indifferently as she could:</p>

<p>"Why didn't you let me know sooner, Peter, that you were coming
to Transylvania? In fact," she went on coolly, "you never did let
me know at all. I first heard through others that you were
here."</p>

<p>"Who told you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I think Jasper did first," she replied. "He had heard the news
from General Naniescu."</p>

<p>Then only did she turn and look at him. She had to look up,
because, though she herself was very tall, one always had to look
up at Peter, who was a young giant. At this moment she certainly
did not think that he was changed. He looked just the same, with
his very boyish face and laughing grey eyes, and his fair hair that
so often looked as if it had been Marcel-waved. He was looking down
at her when she turned to him, and suddenly he said:</p>

<p>"You don't look happy, Rosemary!"</p>

<p>Of course she laughed and told him not to make silly remarks.
How could she help being happy here with these dear, kind people?
Never, never in all her life had she met with such kindness and
hospitality. Peter shrugged his shoulders. He thrust his hands in
the pockets of his flannel trousers and looked down at the toes of
his shoes.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said lightly, "if you won't tell me, you won't.
And that's that. But let me tell you this: though I dare say I am a
bit of a fool, I am not quite such an ass as not to see the
difference in you. You've gotten thinner. When I first arrived and
shook hands with you, your hand felt hot, and your eyes—"</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly, and then with sudden irrelevance:
"Where's Jasper?"</p>

<p>"Gone to—," she began, and suddenly came to a halt. When
she promised Jasper not to breathe a word of Philip's and Anna's
affairs to Peter, she had not realized how difficult this would be.
Would she be breaking her promise if she now told Peter that Jasper
was in Bucharest. He would ask questions, more questions which
Rosemary's promise bound her not to answer.</p>

<p>"He has been called away on business," she said curtly.</p>

<p>Her hesitation had only lasted a second or two; she hoped that
Peter had not noticed it. Anyway, when he asked: "To Budapest?" she
replied, without hesitation this time: "Yes, to Budapest." And she
added quite gaily: "He'll be back at the end of the week. You can't
think, Peter, how I miss him when he is away! Perhaps that is why I
am looking thin, and why my hands are hot."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Peter assented laconically.</p>

<p>Then somehow the conversation flagged, and all the happy feeling
that Rosemary had experienced when Peter first stood near her
slipped away from her. She suddenly felt cold, although the evening
was so hot that a little while ago she had scarcely been able to
breathe. At some little distance behind her Philip's voice sounded
cheerful and homely, and Maurus Imrey's throaty laugh and Elza's
happy little giggle rang through the sweet-scented evening air.
Poor Rosemary shivered.</p>

<p>"Shall we walk on," she asked, "Or wait for the others?"</p>

<p>"Let's walk on," Peter replied; then added in a clumsy, boyish
fashion: "Rather!"</p>

<p>They walked on side by side. Rosemary, at a loss what to say
next, had thrown out an inquiry about the cricket match. This set
Peter talking. All at once he threw off his abrupt, constrained
air, and prattled away nineteen to the dozen. The cricket match was
going to be a huge success. Didn't Rosemary think it was a grand
idea? Talk about the League of Nations, or whatever the thing was
called! In Peter's opinion, there was nothing like a jolly good
cricket or football match to bring people together. Make them
understand one another, was Peter's motto. Of course, all these
dagoes over here had got to learn to be proper sports. No sulking
if they got beaten. Peter would see to that. Anyhow, the old
General What's-his-name had been a brick. He had helped Peter no
end to get the Roumanian team together, and had given them all free
passes to Hódmezö, where the match would take place. Hódmezö was in
Hungary, and old What's-his-name—meaning Naniescu—said
he would rather the Roumanian team went to Hungary than that the
Hungarian team came over here. Well, Peter didn't mind which. It
was going to be a topping affair. He was going to captain the
Roumanian team, and Payson was captaining the Hungarians. Did
Rosemary know Payson? Jolly chap with a ripping wife—done
splendid work in the Air Force during the war. He had something to
do with the Military Commission on disarmaments. He was at Budapest
now, and Jasper would probably see him while he was there. Payson
was coming over to Hódmezö by aeroplane. Wouldn't that create a
sensation. There was a splendid landing ground quite close to
Hódmezö fortunately. Payson's wife was coming with him. She was so
keen on flying. Ripping couple, they were! Didn't Rosemary think
so? Oh! and Peter had had telegrams of good wishes from no end of
people, and a jolly letter from dear old Plum Warner. Did Rosemary
know Plum Warner? There was a cricketer if you like! No one like
him, in Peter's opinion. The science of the man! Well, the dagoes
should learn that cricket is the finest game in the world! Didn't
Rosemary agree with him?</p>

<p>Rosemary gave monosyllabic replies whenever Peter gave her the
chance of putting in a word. She could not help smiling at his
enthusiasm, of course. It was so young, so English, so thoroughly,
thoroughly fine! But somehow she could not recapture that lovely
feeling of security, that sheer joy in having Peter near her, and
she kept asking herself whether it was really Peter who had
changed—who had become younger, or she who had grown old. In
this youthful athlete with his self-assurance and his slang, she
vainly sought the wayward, sometimes moody, always captivating
Peter, whose tempestuous love-making had once swept her off her
feet.</p>

<p>At one moment she tried to lead the conversation into a more
serious channel: "How do you think Anna is looking?" she asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>"A bit peaky." Peter replied lightly, "poor little mole! When
you go back to England," he went on more gravely, "you ought to
take her with you. It would do her all the good in the world. Take
her out of herself, I mean."</p>

<p>"She wouldn't come," Rosemary replied earnestly.</p>

<p>"Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Why, Peter," she retorted, feeling exasperated with him for
this air of indifference even where Anna was concerned, "you know
Anna would not come. For one thing," Rosemary added impulsively, "I
don't suppose she would be allowed to."</p>

<p>"You mean her mother wouldn't let her?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied laconically. "I didn't mean that."</p>

<p>"Well, then?" he retorted. Then, as Rosemary, shocked, angry,
remained silent, holding her lips tightly pressed together, almost
as if she were afraid that words would slip out against her will,
Peter shrugged his broad shoulders and rejoined flippantly:</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose you mean old
What's-his-name—Naniescu—and all that rubbish. I don't
think he would worry much. He has been a brick, letting Anna and
Philip out like that. I expect he would just as soon see them both
out of the country as not. Jolly good thing it would be for both of
them! They would learn some sense, the monkeys!"</p>

<p>He paused and looked round at Rosemary. Then, as she seemed to
persist in her silence, he insisted:</p>

<p>"Don't you agree with me?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she replied, with a weary sigh.</p>

<p>"Anyway, you'll think it over, won't you?" Peter went on. "I am
sure you could fix it up with old Naniescu. He admires you
tremendously, you know."</p>

<p>It was all wrong, all wrong. Peter used to be so fond of little
Anna. "Give her a kiss for me," were almost the last words he had
spoken to Rosemary on the day of her wedding. His own affairs
evidently pushed every other consideration into the remotest corner
of his brain; and cricket matches were apparently of more
importance than the danger which threatened Anna and Philip. Nor
had Rosemary any longer the desire to break her promise to Jasper.
She no longer wished to speak to Peter about Anna and Philip, or
about the horrible alternative which Naniescu had put before her.
Peter—this Peter—would not understand. Jasper had not
understood either—but he had misunderstood in a different
way. Rosemary realized how right he had been to extract that
promise from her. Was not Jasper always right? And was it intuition
that had prompted him, after all, rather than an attack of jealousy
of which Rosemary, in her heart, had been so ready to accuse
him?</p>

<p>Suddenly she felt a longing to get away from Peter, from this
Peter whom she neither knew nor trusted. "I'll go in now, I think,"
she said abruptly; "the dew is rising, and my shoes are very
thin."</p>

<p>And she started to walk more quickly. Slowly the shades of
evening had been drawing in. Rosemary had not noticed before how
dark it was getting. The line of shrubbery behind the perennial
border was like a solid wall; and on the other side of the path the
stretch of lawn, with its great clumps of pampas grass and specimen
trees, became merged in the gathering shadows. Beyond the lawn
glimmered the lights of the chateau, and the veranda in front of
the drawing-room was like a great patch of golden light, broken by
the long, straight lines of its supporting columns. There was no
moon, only an infinity of stars; and in the flower border the riot
of colour had faded into the gloom, leaving just the white
flowers—the nicotiana, the Madonna lilies, a few
violas—to break the even mantle spread by the night.</p>

<p>From the direction of the chateau there came a loud call of
"Hallo!" to which Peter gave a lusty response. A voice shouted: "We
are going in!"</p>

<p>"Right-o!" Peter responded. "We'll come in too!"</p>

<p>Then suddenly he gave a bound, and in an instant had leaped the
border and disappeared in the shrubbery beyond. Rosemary, taken
completely by surprise, had come to a halt. From the shrubbery
there came a loud cry of terror, then a swear-word from Peter, and
finally a string of ejaculations, all in Hungarian, and of
distressful appeals for mercy in the name of all the saints in the
calendar. The next moment Peter's white flannels glimmered through
the foliage, and a second or two later he reappeared lower down,
coming up the path and half dragging, half pushing in front of him
a huddled-up mass, scantily clothed in ragged shirt and trousers,
and crowned with a broad-brimmed hat, from beneath which came a
succession of dismal howls.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Rosemary cried.</p>

<p>"That's what I want to know," was Peter's reply. "I caught sight
of this blighter sneaking in the shrubbery, and got him by the ear,
which he does not seem to like, eh, my friend?"</p>

<p>He gave the ear which he held between his fingers another tweak,
and in response drew a howl from his victim, fit to wake the seven
sleepers.</p>

<p>"Mercy, gracious lord! Mercy on a poor man! I was not doing
anything wrong; I swear by holy Joseph I was not doing anything
wrong!"</p>

<p>The creature, whoever he was, succeeded in wriggling himself
free of Peter's unpleasant hold. At once he turned to flee, but
Peter caught him by the shoulder, and proceeded this time to
administer something more severe in the way of punishment.</p>

<p>"Leave the man alone, Peter," Rosemary cried indignantly. "You
have no right to ill-use him like that!"</p>

<p>"Oh, haven't I? We'll soon see about that!" Peter retorted
roughly. "Now then, my friend," he went on, speaking in Hungarian
to the bundle of rags that had collapsed at his feet, "listen to
me. You have tasted the weight of my boot on your spine, so you
know pretty well what you can expect if you don't tell me at once
what you are doing at this hour of the night in the gracious
count's garden?"</p>

<p>The man, however, seemed unable to speak for the moment; loud
hiccoughs shook his tall, spare frame. He held his two hands
against the base of his desperate contortions in a vain attempt to
get his right shoulder out of Peter's grip.</p>

<p>"Peter," Rosemary cried again, "let the poor wretch go. You
must! Or I shall hate you."</p>

<p>But Peter only retorted harshly: "If you weren't here, Rosemary,
I'd thrash the vermin to within an inch of his life. Now then," he
commanded, "stop that howling. What were you doing in their
shrubbery?"</p>

<p>"I only wanted to speak with the gracious countess," the man
contrived to murmur at last, through the hiccoughs that still
seemed to choke the words in his throat. "I have a message for
her!"</p>

<p>"That's why I caught you with this in your belt, eh?" Peter
queried sternly, and drew something out of his pocket, which
Rosemary could not see; he showed it to the man who promptly made a
fresh appeal to the saints.</p>

<p>"The roads are not safe for poor gipsies, gracious lord. And I
had the message—"</p>

<p>"Who gave you a message for the gracious countess?" Rosemary
asked him gently.</p>

<p>"I—I don't know, gracious lady. A fine gentleman on a
horse called to me when I was gathering wood over by the forest of
Normafa. He gave me a letter. 'Take it,' he said, 'to the gracious
countess over at Kis-Imre, but do not give it into any hands but
hers, and only give it to her when she is alone.'"</p>

<p>"Where is the letter?"</p>

<p>"It is here, gracious lady," the man replied and fumbling with
the belt that held his ragged trousers round his waist, he drew
from underneath it a oiled and crumpled rag that effectively looked
like a letter in a sealed envelope. Peter would have snatched it
out of his hand, but Rosemary interposed.</p>

<p>"Peter," she said gravely, and stretched a protecting arm over
the gipsy's hand, "the man was told not to give it in any hand but
Elza's!"</p>

<p>"The man is a liar," Peter riposted harshly.</p>

<p>Just then Philip's voice reached them from across the lawn.</p>

<p>"What are you two doing over there?"</p>

<p>"Philip, is your mother with you?" Rosemary shouted in
response.</p>

<p>"Yes! We are just going in."</p>

<p>"Ask her to wait a moment then."</p>

<p>"What has happened?" Elza called.</p>

<p>"Nothing, darling," Rosemary replied. "Send the others in and
wait for me, will you?" Then she turned to the gipsy, and said
kindly: "Walk beside me, and don't try to run away; the gracious
lord will not hurt you if you walk quietly beside me."</p>

<p>And so the three of them walked across the lawn toward the
chateau, Rosemary in front, and beside her the gipsy, whose long
thin hands almost swept the grass as he walked with bent knees and
arched back, throwing from time to time anxious glances behind him.
But Peter was lagging behind.</p>

<p>When they were close to the chateau, they saw Elza coming down
the veranda steps. Rosemary ordered the gipsy to wait, and ran to
meet Elza; in a few words she told her what had occurred. Elza then
came across the gravel path, and said to the gipsy: "I am the
Countess Imrey. You may give me the letter!"</p>

<p>The man's back became more curved than ever; he nearly touched
the ground with his forehead. In the darkness Rosemary seemed to
see his long, thin body curling itself up almost into a ball.</p>

<p>"I was told," he murmured meekly, "to give the letter into the
hands of the gracious countess only when she was alone."</p>

<p>Instinctively Rosemary turned to look for Peter. To her surprise
she saw him just above her, going up the veranda steps. He had his
hands in the pockets of his trousers, and he was whistling a
tune.</p>

<p>The gipsy whom he had so maltreated a little while ago no longer
seemed to interest him. Rosemary called to him rather
impatiently:</p>

<p>"Peter!"</p>

<p>He paused and looked down at her. "Hallo!" he said coolly.</p>

<p>"Do you think it is all right for Elza to talk with this man
alone?"</p>

<p>Peter shrugged his shoulders. "Why not?" he said, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>Then he called out to Elza:</p>

<p>"I say, Aunt Elza, if the wretch should try to kiss you, sing
out, won't you?"</p>

<p>Elza laughed good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"Of course I am not afraid," she said. "And I do want to know
about this mysterious letter."</p>

<p>Rosemary would have liked to argue the point. She could not
understand how it was that Peter took the matter so lightly all of
a sudden. However, as Elza was playfully pushing her out of the
way, whilst Peter calmly continued to stroll up the stairs, she
only said with a final note of earnestness: "I shall be quite
close, Elza. You have only to call, you know."</p>

<p>"I know, I know," Elza rejoined, still laughing. "You don't
suppose that I am frightened of a gipsy, do you?"</p>

<p>She waited a moment or two until Rosemary was out of sight, then
she turned back to the man, and said:</p>

<p>"I am alone now. You may give me the letter."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 18</h2>

<p>Rosemary went slowly up the veranda steps. She did not feel that
it would be loyal to pry into Elza's secrets, but at the same time
she wanted to remain well within call. From where she was she could
see Peter's broad shoulders blocking the French window which gave
on the drawing-room. From somewhere in the house, both above and
below stairs, came the sound of laughter and song.</p>

<p>A moment or two later she heard Elza's footsteps behind her on
the gravel walk, and presently Elza was there, going up the veranda
steps beside Rosemary. She did not say a word, and Rosemary asked
no questions. She could see that Elza was preoccupied. She also
noticed that the letter—or whatever it was—was not in
Elza's hands.</p>

<p>Peter stood aside to allow the two ladies to step into the
drawing-room. He asked no questions either, and Elza did not
volunteer any information. It seemed as if the incident of the
mysterious gipsy had never been. Later on Peter sat down at the
piano and played a <i>csàrdàs</i>, for Philip and Anna to dance.
They were beautiful dancers, both of them, and it was a pleasure to
watch them swaying and bending to the syncopated cadences of the
beautiful Hungarian music. Peter, too, had evidently that music in
the blood. Rosemary had no idea he could play it so well. He seemed
just as excited as the dancers, and accelerated the movements of
the <i>csàrdàs</i> until little Anna called for mercy, and even
Philip seemed ready to give in. For the time being Rosemary forgot
her troubles in the joy of seeing those two enjoying themselves,
and the delight of listening to Peter. What a pity, she thought, as
she had often done, that he should waste all the poetry, the talent
that was in him, and only devote his mind to cricket. She drew
close up to the piano, to watch his slender fingers flying over the
keys, and as she did so, her glance at one moment wandered to the
small what-not in the corner by the piano. There, in the midst of a
miscellaneous collection of cigarette boxes, ash-trays,
match-boxes, lay a small automatic.</p>

<p>Peter caught her eye, which at the moment expressed a mute
inquiry. He shrugged his shoulders and smiled. He had a cigarette
in a long holder in the corner of his mouth, but he contrived to
murmur:</p>

<p>"Yes, the blighter; wasn't I right to thrash him?"</p>

<p>Rosemary looked across at Elza. She sat quite placidly, as she
always did, close to her husband's chair, watching her
Philip—her soul in her eyes. She was smiling, and now and
then she turned to say a word or two to Maurus; but to Rosemary she
still looked preoccupied, and once she caught Elza's large kind
eyes fixed upon her with a curious, scrutinizing gaze.</p>

<p>An hour later when Rosemary was in her room and beginning to
undress, there was a knock at her door, and Elza came in, with that
kindly smile of hers still on her face, but with a troubled look in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"May I come in for a moment, darling?" she asked.</p>

<p>Rosemary made her comfortable on the sofa, and sat down beside
her. Elza took hold of both her hands and fondled them, stroking
them up and down, and she began talking about Philip and Anna, and
the dancing and the plans for future parties, and picnics and so
on. Rosemary let her prattle on; it was her turn to scrutinize
Elza's face closely. That something was troubling this dear, kind
creature was obvious. She was, as it were, gathering her moral
forces before she broached something unpleasant that she had come
to say. It was no use brusquing the matter, and Rosemary entered
into Elza's plans, discussed the coming dinner-parties, the
proposed lists of guests, talked about Anna's future, and made some
remarks about Peter.</p>

<p>This brought the main subject on the tapis.</p>

<p>"Where did you and Peter first see that gipsy?" Elza asked
presently.</p>

<p>"He was hiding in the shrubbery," Rosemary replied, "behind the
flower border. I didn't see him. Peter saw him and pounced upon
him, and dragged him out on to the path."</p>

<p>"Funny he did not just go to the service door and ask for me,
wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"That's what Peter thought. I am afraid he treated the poor
wretch rather roughly."</p>

<p>"I am sorry he did that," Elza mused, and thoughtfully stroked
Rosemary's slender fingers between her own. "The man really had a
message for me."</p>

<p>"I know," Rosemary rejoined; "a letter."</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't a letter," Elza said, and looked Rosemary now
straight between the eyes. "You know these gipsies are queer
people. They have curious gifts of divination and prophecy. This
man—"</p>

<p>She seemed to hesitate, her glance wavered, and once more she
started mechanically stroking Rosemary's hands.</p>

<p>"But the man had a letter for you, Elza dear," Rosemary
insisted. "I saw it in his hand."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was only a blind; and so was his story about the
gentleman on a horse. He told me that he had come all the way from
Ujlak to speak with me. Ujlak is where I was born, and my dear
brother and Peter's mother. My sister-in-law lives there still.
Anna was born there, and little Marie. It was my father's home and
my grandfather's before him, and our ancestors' for many
generations. Well, this gipsy came from there."</p>

<p>"In order to speak with you?"</p>

<p>"So he said."</p>

<p>"Well, and what did he have to tell you?" Rosemary asked.</p>

<p>"That he had had a vision. My father had appeared before him in
a dream, and told him that he must start at once and seek me. He
was to tell me that he whom I love best in all the world is in
immediate danger of death."</p>

<p>Rosemary never moved; she was looking straight at Elza. Only
when Elza paused, seeming to wait for some word from her, Rosemary
said:</p>

<p>"That wretched creature told you that?"</p>

<p>Elza nodded. She went on simply:</p>

<p>"I see by your face, dear, that he told the truth, not only in
that, but in what he said was to follow."</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"He said that the stranger now within our gates knows of this
danger, and would confirm what he said. Well, my darling, I only
need look at your sweet face to see that that miserable wretch
spoke the truth. He was inspired by a dream to come and speak with
me. But I would not question him further. Those gipsies often lie,
and they will tell you any tale in order to get a few coppers. But
I saw your look when I told you what he said, and it is from you
that I want the truth. What is the danger that threatens
Philip?"</p>

<p>"Elza, darling—" Rosemary murmured.</p>

<p>"I am his mother, you know," Elza interposed, with her gentle,
quiet smile. "I must know. He is all the world to me. And as soon
as you knew that something threatened him, you should have told me,
my darling."</p>

<p>Then, as Rosemary was still fighting with herself, alternately
praying to God for guidance, and striving to swallow the tears that
were choking her, Elza went on quite quietly:</p>

<p>"It is difficult for you, of course," she said, and patted
Rosemary's cheek like an indulgent mother, "but it would have been
better to tell me at first. I have had a very, very happy week
since the children came home, but looking back on it now, I don't
think that I was ever quite free from a vague sort of doubt. I was
always a little uneasy, and whenever Philip kissed me, I could not
help crying."</p>

<p>Elza had spoken in a curious, dreamy manner, her round blue eyes
fixed somewhere on vacant space. But now she seemed to pull herself
together, she looked once more at Rosemary, gave her an encouraging
smile, and said in a perfectly quiet, matter-of-fact tone:</p>

<p>"Well, now tell me all about it. Philip's release and Anna's is
only a temporary one. Is that it?"</p>

<p>Rosemary nodded. She could not trust herself to speak. Elza gave
a little gasp, but her voice was still quite steady as she went on
questioning Rosemary:</p>

<p>"What is the charge against them?"</p>

<p>"Philip wrote certain newspaper articles," Rosemary replied, and
her voice sounded mechanical, like that of an automaton, "which
have appeared in the English and American press. Anna used to send
those through in the parcels she packed up in Balog's shop."</p>

<p>"I knew about those articles," Elza rejoined simply. "Everybody
in Transylvania knew about them, but I did not guess that Philip
had anything to do with them, or Anna. Then," she went on with a
little catch in her throat, "it means a charge of treason against
the State?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"Military tribunal?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And—if they are found guilty—a sentence of
death?"</p>

<p>"No! No! No!" And Rosemary was on her knees with her arms round
Elza's shoulders, her tear-stained face turned up to her,
protesting vigorously, strenuously, that which she knew was false.
But Elza's big, round eyes were tearless; she looked a little
wildly perhaps, but quite kindly into the beautiful face that
expressed such a world of love and sympathy. Then, gently but
firmly, she disengaged herself from Rosemary's arms.</p>

<p>"Well now, my dear," she asked, very quietly, "all this being
so, why did Naniescu let those children come home at all? Why
should he postpone their trial, their—their punishment?"</p>

<p>Rosemary's head fell upon her breast.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she murmured.</p>

<p>But Elza put her podgy finger under Rosemary's chin, and forced
her to look up.</p>

<p>"Don't lie to me, darling," she pleaded softly; "tell me the
truth."</p>

<p>"I have told you the truth, Elza," Rosemary protested through
her tears.</p>

<p>"Then I must believe you, if you say so. And yet it is all very
mysterious. Why should Naniescu wait? Why should he play with those
poor children, like a cat does with a mouse? You know, Rosemary
darling, what they gipsy said in the end?"</p>

<p>Rosemary shook her head.</p>

<p>"He said that the stranger within the gates had the power to
save my son from death. Have you that power, Rosemary?"</p>

<p>"No! No!" Rosemary protested wildly. "If it were in my power,
don't you think that I would do anything in the world to save
Philip and Anna?"</p>

<p>Elza nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," she said gently. "Of course I do think it; but when
the gipsy said that, I could not help feeling hopeful, for he was
right in everything else he said—"</p>

<p>Then suddenly she took Rosemary's face between her two hands,
and she gazed into her eyes with a look of almost fierce intensity
in her own, as if she would wrest a secret from the depths of the
younger woman's soul.</p>

<p>"Swear to me, Rosemary," she said, and her gentle voice sounded
raucous and harsh, "swear to me that there is nothing in the world
that you can do to save Philip!"</p>

<p>And Rosemary, returning her gaze, replied steadily:</p>

<p>"I swear to you that it is not in my power to save Philip and
Anna. If it were, I would do it."</p>

<p>Even then Elza did not cry. She just sat there quite, quite
still, her big, round eyes quite dry, her mouth without a quiver,
but sitting there so still, so still with her beautiful golden hair
all round her face, the soft streaks of grey all about her temples,
her fine features rigid, her podgy white hands resting on her
knees; she looked such a tragic figure of despair that Rosemary
could hardly suppress the cry of anguish that rose insistently to
her throat.</p>

<p>"And so we can do nothing," Elza said, with a note of quiet
finality in her voice.</p>

<p>"Don't say that, dear," Rosemary protested. "Jasper, as a matter
of fact, has gone to Bucharest to try and see the King personally.
The Roumanian Government owes some gratitude to my husband, as you
know. I am quite sure that he will bring strong pressure to bear
upon the authorities, and get a full pardon for Philip and Anna on
the score of their youth."</p>

<p>But Elza slowly shook her head.</p>

<p>"You don't believe yourself, darling," she said, "in what you
say. The children have committed the unpardonable crime of being
born Hungarians, and of resenting foreign tyranny in their native
land. The King himself would be kind, I am sure, but Bucharest is a
long way off, and the bureaucrats over here do not know the meaning
of the word 'mercy'."</p>

<p>"But we know the meaning of the word 'hope,' Elza dear,"
Rosemary said steadily, and struggled to her feet. "We are not
going to give up hope. You talk about your gipsies having the gift
of prophecy. Well, it is my turn to prophesy now. Philip and Anna
are in God's hands, and you and I are going to pray so hard and so
ceaselessly that God will help us, I am sure. I know," she added
firmly.</p>

<p>Elza gave a short, quick sigh.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she said, "you are lucky, you English! Your religion
means a great deal to you. But we, over here, are so different. We
go to convent schools when we are too young to understand. Then we
are all fire and enthusiasm, but we do not understand. After that
we marry and live in those remote villages where the poor
<i>curé</i> is only an illiterate peasant with whom we have nothing
in common, whose habits are often such that we could not possibly
make our confession to him. And so we soon forget what we learned
in our childhood, and we come to trusting in ourselves rather than
in God."</p>

<p>She rose and, with the same motherly gentleness which she always
showed to Rosemary, she folded the girl in her loving arms.</p>

<p>"Good night, my dear," she said placidly. "I ought not to have
kept you up so late. Good night, dear. Pray to your God for us all.
The God of the English is more merciful, I think, than ours."</p>

<p>"Elza," Rosemary insisted, "promise me that you will not give up
hope. Jasper comes back to-morrow. He may bring the best of news.
Promise me that in any case you will not give up hope."</p>

<p>The ghost of a smile appeared on Elza's face.</p>

<p>"I will promise," she said, "not altogether to give up
faith."</p>

<p>Rosemary kissed her tenderly. After that she escorted her as far
as her room, and at the door she kissed her once more, and then she
said, with solemn earnestness:</p>

<p>"Elza darling, will you believe me if I say that if I could give
my life for those two children I would do it? If it were in my
power to save them, I would. But it is not in my power to save
them, to do anything, but to leave them in God's hands."</p>

<p>Elza returned her kiss with gentleness and affection.</p>

<p>"Dear, kind Rosemary," she murmured; "go to bed, dear, you must
be so tired."</p>

<p>Then she quietly slipped into her room and closed the door. And
Rosemary was left to face the night alone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 19</h2>

<p>What puzzled Rosemary was the gipsy.</p>

<p>What was the mystery of that vagabond found lurking in the park
at nightfall with a revolver in his belt? What connexion had he
with the eyes that had watched Rosemary the night that she was
talking with little Anna? And how had he come in possession of the
inner history of Philip's and Anna's temporary release?</p>

<p>There was a mystery here. Somewhere. A disquieting, a terrifying
mystery, not altogether to be accounted for by the spy system or
other secret organization of the Roumanian Government.</p>

<p>All night Rosemary struggled with the puzzle. All night she
wrestled with herself for the right to break her promise to Jasper
and to lay all the facts of this case before Peter. She wanted to
do this before Jasper's return, and, anyway, he must release
her—he must—from that promise which placed her in a
false and disloyal position towards Peter. When Rosemary fell
asleep the dawn was breaking, and she had almost made up her mind
to tell Peter everything.</p>

<p>But the next morning when she went downstairs she found the
whole house in a turmoil. Servants rushing to and fro, Elza in
close conversation with the chef, Maurus shouting contradictory
orders across the galleried hall. Peter was in the drawing-room
playing a jazz tune this time, and Philip and Anna were
fox-trotting, infusing even into this ugly so-called dance some of
their own native grace.</p>

<p>As soon as Rosemary appeared she was greeted with regular
war-whoops of delight. In a moment she was drawn into the whirlpool
of excitement. Philip and Anna dragged her to the sofa, and they
and Maurus and Elza all talked to her at once, while Peter, with
the inevitable cigarette in the corner of his mouth, continued to
pound away at the jazz tune.</p>

<p>From the deafening hubbub of conversation Rosemary gathered, in
the first instance, that the gipsy band from Bonczhida were coming
over the next day, and the gipsies of Bonczhida were the finest in
Transylvania. Then that the Keletys were driving over from Hajdu,
and the Fejérs from Henger; that perhaps Aunt Charlotte would come
too and bring Marie; that the Keletys were bringing the Poltys, and
the Fejérs having the Kékesy boys staying with them would of course
bring them along. They reckoned that there would be ten or a dozen
couples to dance, and with the mammas and papas they would be
thirty to supper. They expected most of the guests to arrive in
time for luncheon, and in the afternoon they could have some
tennis; then in the evening they would have a ball to which the
officers from the garrison at Cluj had already been invited, and
they had accepted by telephone. Among them were those who were
going to play cricket with the Hungarians at Hódmezö under Peter's
direction.</p>

<p>At this marvellous statement Peter came to a pause in the music
with a crashing chord, took the cigarette out of his mouth, and
throwing up his hands, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Going to play cricket with the Hungarians under Peter's
direction! Oh, blessed People! Ye ghosts of Fitzgerald, Pycroft,
and of Lillywhite, do ye hear them and writhe up there in
Heaven?"</p>

<p>Then he struck up the "March of the Men of Harlech."</p>

<p>"If anyone says anything more about cricket," he said solemnly,
"I shall force them to play with warped bats and golf-balls on a
ploughed field."</p>

<p>Not a trace of anxiety or even preoccupation on any of those
dear, beaming faces. Elza was as excited as any of them, worried to
death because the carp they had got out of the lake for this
evening's supper were not really fat.</p>

<p>"They're no bigger than a good-sized goldfish," she said to
Rosemary with a note of real tragedy in her voice, and her blue
eyes at once looked anxious and troubled, as if the matter of the
carp was the only thing that could worry her.</p>

<p>Rosemary made a great effort not to be a wet blanket in the
midst of all this gaiety. In this she succeeded admirably. All she
had to do was to smile and to nod her head, and now and then to cry
out, "How splendid!" The others did all the talking, and when
conversation subsided for a moment Peter came down with a fresh,
crashing jazz tune.</p>

<p>Rosemary would have thought the whole scene a
phantasmagoria—illusive images that would presently be
dispelled—only that she had known these people ever since she
was a child. She had studied their curious psychology, half
barbaric, with all the primitive disregard of danger and the
passion for pleasure, even at the point of death. She gave
ungrudging admiration to Elza—Elza who had sat in her room
last night, rigid, dry-eyed, a living statue of despair. What went
on behind that smooth, white brow of hers? What projects? What
hopes? And little Anna? Anna knew. Anna guessed. She had spoken of
her fears to Rosemary. Spoken of eyes that watched her, of eyes
that were willing her to do something foolish that would compromise
her irretrievably this time. Elza and Anna! What an example of
self-possession, of self-control! Rosemary was almost ready to
persuade herself that something had happened to reassure them
both—that, in fact, they knew the danger to be past.</p>

<p>Only that Elza avoided her glance, and that the dear soul,
usually so placid, so stable, was just a thought more restless than
usual, and her gentle voice would from time to time become
shrill.</p>

<p>At last, genuinely tired and bewildered by so much noise,
Rosemary jumped up and, laughing, declared that she must escape out
of the bear-garden for a moment and get a breath of fresh air in
the park. In order to reach the glass door that gave on the
veranda, Rosemary had to go past the piano. Quite close. Peter
looked up when she was near him, and she said to him as she went
past: "They are very gay, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Elza has a perfectly mad plan in her head," Peter replied, and
struck a few loud chords so that no one save Rosemary should hear
what he said. "For God's sake, if you have any influence over her,
get her to give it up."</p>

<p>Then he shouted merrily: "I've had enough of those horrible
American tunes. Who wants a csàrdàs?"</p>

<p>But he did not play a csàrdàs. For a moment or two his fingers
wandered aimlessly over the keys, whilst his eyes followed Rosemary
as she stepped through the glass door on to the sun-bathed veranda.
And as Rosemary felt the sun, the clear, luscious air, the scent of
flowers and of distant pines, envelop her as in a warm mantle,
there came wafted to her ears the soft strains of that exquisite
Hungarian love-song: "There is but one beautiful girl in all the
world." The piano now seemed to sing under Peter's delicate touch
and Rosemary paused and stood quite, quite still, letting the music
sink into her, yielding to its voluptuous cadence, and allowing her
thoughts, her desires, her longings, to soar upwards to that
infinity to which music alone can convey the soul on its magic
wings.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 20</h2>

<p>Rosemary had wandered beyond the confines of the park, and
roamed about in the woods, having lost all sense of time. When
presently she came back to the reality of things she looked at her
watch and saw that it was close on twelve o'clock. Luncheon at the
chateau was at half-past. It meant stepping out briskly so as to be
in time.</p>

<p>As soon as she reached the flower-garden, it struck her as
strange that the château suddenly appeared to be so quiet. No sound
reached her as she came near to the veranda steps, either of
shrill, excited voices, or of laughter or song.</p>

<p>She found the family assembled on the veranda—Maurus,
Elza, Philip and Anna. Only Peter was not there. A first glance at
them all revealed to Rosemary what had occurred. Elza had told them
what the gipsy had said. Maurus sat in his chair like a man in a
trance, his dark face flushed, his hair towzled, his large, dark
eyes staring out before him, with a look in them that was not
entirely sane.</p>

<p>Philip, on the other hand, was pacing up and down the veranda
floor, whilst Anna stood quite still, leaning against a column,
looking for all the world like a little martyr tied to the stake,
her small, thin hands clasped together, a faint flush on her
cheeks. These two children looked excited rather than
horror-filled. Anna's face suggested that of an idealist—not
altogether resigned, but nevertheless eager to suffer for the
cause. But Philip looked like a fighter, seeking for a chance to
hit back, a combatant not yet brought to his knees.</p>

<p>Elza's round, blue eyes just wandered from one to the other of
these faces all dear to her.</p>

<p>They were dry eyes, anxious eyes, but there was nothing in them
to-day of that tragic despair which had been so heart-breaking to
behold the evening before.</p>

<p>Rosemary's first thought had been: "They know. Elza has told
them!" The second was "Elza has a plan. Peter said it was a mad
one. A plan for Philip and Anna's escape." She wondered if they
would tell her.</p>

<p>"I hope I am not late for lunch," she said, rather breathlessly,
as she had been walking very fast. Then she added casually: "Where
is Peter?"</p>

<p>"He is busy packing," Elza replied.</p>

<p>"Packing?" Rosemary exclaimed, puzzled. "He is not going away
already?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Elza said, "to-night."</p>

<p>"But he did not say anything yesterday," Rosemary insisted,
"about going away again so soon. Or even this morning."</p>

<p>"I don't think he knew yesterday," Elza rejoined. "It seems he
had a telephone message half an hour ago. He says he must go."</p>

<p>Anna now appeared to wake out of her trance. Rosemary was
standing close to her just then; she took Rosemary's hand gently in
hers and said:</p>

<p>"You see, darling, it is like this: one of Peter's cricketers
has telephoned to him to say that they have such a lot of trouble
about their rooms at Hódmezö. Roumanians are not exactly popular in
Hungary," she went on with a wan little smile, "and I suppose that
hotel-keepers don't care to put them up. So Peter had to promise to
go and put things right for his cricketers."</p>

<p>"He will come back, of course, after the cricket match," Elza
concluded placidly. "But it is a great nuisance for him, packing
and unpacking all the time."</p>

<p>Rosemary made no further remark. Everything seemed terribly
puzzling. That Elza had told the children, had told Maurus, all she
knew, was beyond the question. That Peter also knew everything, and
that he knew and disapproved of some plan which Elza had made,
Rosemary supposed, for the escape of Philip and Anna was, to her
mind, equally certain. But even if Peter disapproved, how could he
go away at this critical time, and leave Elza to plan and contrive
alone, hampered by a half-crazy husband, and surrounded by spies?
However, no one apparently meant to say anything more just then,
and it was quite a relief when the luncheon-bell sounded and the
little party on the veranda broke up and everyone trooped
downstairs for luncheon.</p>

<p>Peter was already in the dining-room, waiting for the others.
Elza in her kind, gentle way asked him about his packing, and
whether she could help him to get ready. But Peter declared that he
wanted nothing, only the carriage this evening to take him to
Cluj.</p>

<p>He grumbled terribly at having to go away. He hated the idea of
missing the ball and all the friends who were coming; but when Elza
or Maurus tried to persuade him to stay, he was very firm. "I've
got to go, Aunt Elza. You don't know what complications might occur
if those Roumanians got to Hódmezö and were not properly treated.
Good God!" he added, with mock horror, "it might land you all in
another war! And all through my fault!"</p>

<p>Rosemary had never seen Peter so gay or conversational. He
appeared entirely unconscious of the undercurrent of tragedy that
flowed through Elza's pathetic attempts at conversation, and
Maurus's equally tragic silences. He talked incessantly, chiefly
about the cricket match and chiefly to Philip, who made desperate
efforts to appear interested. Rosemary did her best, too, but she
was anxious and puzzled, and frankly she did not believe in the
story of the telephone message.</p>

<p>She tried now and then to catch Elza's eye, but in this she
never once succeeded. Elza was avoiding her glance. She meant to
say nothing about her plan—this mad plan of which Peter
disapproved so thoroughly that he preferred to be out of the way.
Did these dear, kind people mistrust her then, because of what the
gipsy had said? Or was this reticence merely the natural outcome of
a sense of supreme danger that mistrusted everything and
everybody?</p>

<p>Rosemary felt the mystery deepening around her. She could not
understand Peter.</p>

<p>Sometime after luncheon she found Elza and Anna sitting together
in the small brick-built summer-house at the farther end of the
lake. Rosemary had wandered as far as there with a book, anxious as
she was to be out of the way. It was hot, and the air was very
still, and the scent of tuberoses and heliotrope was almost too
heady. In the perennial border a number of humming-bird moths were
busy about a bed of sweet sultan; the soft whirring sound of their
wings could be heard quite distinctly in the extreme stillness of
this late summer's afternoon. From time to time distant sounds of
village life came in quick, short waves to Rosemary's ear, as well
as the sharp click of tools wielded by the gardeners at work
somewhere in the park. Close beside the summer-house one man was
busy hand-weeding the path. As Rosemary drew nearer, he looked up
for an instant, and then he shuffled rapidly away. In the long,
stooping figure, the dirty rags and the dark skin, Rosemary thought
that she recognized the gipsy of the previous night. It was just
like Elza, she thought, to give the poor wretch work on the
estate.</p>

<p>When Rosemary saw Elza and Anna sitting together in the
summer-house, her instinct was to pass discreetly on, with just a
hasty, cheery word, but Elza called to her.</p>

<p>"Come and sit here a minute, Rosemary darling," she said. "Anna
and I want to tell you everything."</p>

<p>Everything! Rosemary without a word stepped into the little
pavilion. Anna pulled a wicker chair forward between herself and
Elza, and Rosemary sat down, a little anxious, a little fearful,
wondering what these dear, enthusiastic hotheads had devised, and
how she herself would act when she knew. Elza at once took hold of
her hand and fondled it.</p>

<p>"You asked me last night, darling," she began, "not to give up
hope, didn't you?"</p>

<p>Rosemary nodded acquiescence.</p>

<p>"And I promised that I would not give up faith," Elza went on
quietly. "Well, I have kept my faith all through last night, which
was very trying. With the dawn, hope came to me, and after that I
once more felt in charity with all the world."</p>

<p>Rosemary gave Elza's podgy white hand a tender squeeze. "Dear!"
she whispered.</p>

<p>"We have a plan, darling," Elza said triumphantly. "A splendid
plan! To-morrow night Philip and Anna will be in Hungary, safely
out of the way."</p>

<p>Rosemary had known all along what was coming. She looked at
Anna, who gave an excited little nod.</p>

<p>"Tell Rosemary, Aunt Elza," she said. "All from the beginning.
There's no one in the world you can trust as you can Rosemary."</p>

<p>"Listen then, darling," Elza said, speaking quite quietly at
first, then allowing excitement to get hold of her voice, making it
tremble while she spoke, and husky with eagerness, while her
command of the English tongue became less and less pronounced.</p>

<p>"It has all been made possible by this cricket business, for
which I thank God and Peter Blakeney. As I told you this morning,
Peter's cricket people are all coming here to-morrow for the ball.
They have to be at Hódmezö the following day for the cricket. So
they will bring their luggage, and make a start from here after the
ball—I suppose about midnight—in three motor-cars which
the Governor, General Naniescu, has himself placed at their
disposition. Hódmezö is, as you know, in Hungary, just the other
side of the frontier. It will be about four or five hour's drive
from here, as there is a short cut—quite a good
road—which avoids Cluj. In two of those motor-cars the
cricket people themselves will go; they are mostly young Roumanian
officers and men of the better class. General Naniescu has, of
course, given them all free passes for the occasion. Fortunately he
has also given them passes for four servants to accompany them.
These four men will go in the third motor, and they will also go in
the motor all the way to Hódmezö. Now two of these servants, whom
the local commissary of police has himself chosen and to whom
passes have been given, are the two sons of János the miller, who
is devoted to us all. His two sons have certainly served in the
Roumanian army because they were obliged, but they have remained
Hungarian at heart and would do anything for me and for
Philip."</p>

<p>Elza paused. Her eager, round eyes searched Rosemary's face.
Rosemary, of course, had already guessed the rest, her own
excitement while she listened was as tense as Elza's. She gripped
the white podgy little hand of her friend, and looked from her to
Anna—a mute question in every glance.</p>

<p>"You can guess, of course?" Anna said.</p>

<p>Rosemary nodded: "I can guess," she said, "but do go on."</p>

<p>"I sent for János early this morning," Elza went on. "All I had
to tell him was that Philip and Anna were in great danger, and must
be got out of the country at any cost. He understood! We Hungarians
in this occupied territory all understand one another. We
understand danger. We live with danger constantly at our door. And
János was so clever, so helpful. I only had to outline my plan, he
thought out all the details. The mill is about a kilometre from
here, the last house in the village; as soon as the first two
motors have gone with the cricket people and the Roumanian
officers, Philip and Anna will at once run round to the mill, and
János will give them clothes belonging to his sons. The clothes
they will put on. In the meanwhile the third motor-car will have
collected the two other men in the village who are going as
servants to Hódmezö—one is the brother of the Jew over at the
inn, and the other the son of the Roumanian storekeeper. Then it
will call at the mill. János will ask the two men to come in. He
and his two sons will give them some strong spirit to drink. The
brother of the Jew and the son of the storekeeper are both of them
great drunkards. When they have become what you English call, I
think, blotto, János will take them back into the motor. There they
will sit; and will probably at once go to sleep. But Philip and
Anna will also get into the motor. They will be dressed in
peasant's clothes, and they will have the free passes which
Naniescu has given to János' sons. They will get to Hódmezö about
five o'clock in the morning. And once they are in Hungary they are
safe. Rosemary darling! they are safe!"</p>

<p>Rosemary had remained silent. The whole thing certainly at first
glance appeared so easy, so simple that she found herself wondering
why she or Jasper—or Peter—had never thought of such a
plan. She also wondered why Peter should have spoken of it as a mad
plan, and begged her if she had any influence with Elza to dissuade
her from it. What had been in his mind when he said that? Of what
was he afraid? Spies, of course. But spies, like the poor, were
always there, and, after all, Philip and Anna would only be risking
what already was forfeit—their lives.</p>

<p>Rosemary sat there in silence, her fingers closed over Elza's
soft, warm hand. She gazed straight before her, thinking. Thinking;
her mind already following Philip and Anna's flight through this
hostile, cruel country, to the land which would mean freedom and
life for them. She saw them in her mind's eye, like a vision
floating before her across the lake, which in this daydream had
become a wide, dusty road with a motor-car speeding along toward
life and toward freedom.</p>

<p>It seemed a solution. It must be a solution. Thank God Jasper
would be there to help with counsel and with suggestions. Elza was
talking again now. In her quaint English, which became more and
more involved, she continued to talk of her plan, as a child will
talk of some event that made it happy. She harped on the details,
on János' devotion, the two sons who would make their way to the
frontier in their father's bullock cart, and then cross over to
Hungary on foot, through the woods and over a mountain pass where
there would be no fear of meeting Roumanian sentinels. At Hódmezö
they would find Peter and the cricket people. They would get back
their passes, and return quite gaily with the others, having saved
the lives of Philip and Anna. Such devotion! Wasn't it
splendid?</p>

<p>Rosemary only nodded from time to time, and from time to time
she squeezed Elza's hand. It was so hot and so airless here in the
little pavilion with those clusters of climbing heliotrope all over
the roof and half-blocking up the entrance. The bees and humming
bird moths were making such a buzzing and a whirring; it was just
like the hum of motor-car wheels on the dusty road. And through it
all came the swishing sound of a garden broom upon the gravel path,
between the summer-house and the stone coping around the ornamental
lake. Rosemary caught herself watching the broom swinging backwards
and forwards across the path, and across; she saw the two
hands—very dark lean hands they were—that wielded the
broom, and finally the gipsy's tall, thin figure bent almost double
to his task. It seemed just right that the man should be there at
this hour, sweeping the path for Elza to walk on presently, for
Philip also and for Anna. It was right because it was the gipsy who
had told Elza what she, Rosemary, had not had the courage to say.
There was very little mystery about the gipsy now; he was just a
ragged, dirty labourer, bending to his task. Did the strange
intuition—or was it divination—that had brought him all
the way from his native village to speak with Elza whisper to him
that his warning had already borne fruit, and that the gracious
lady whom he had come to warn had found in faith and hope the way
out of dark destiny?</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right, darling! We spoke English all the
time!"</p>

<p>Elza said this with a light laugh. Rosemary woke from her
day-dream. She must have been speaking in her dream—about the
gipsy who haunted her thoughts.</p>

<p>"Did I say anything?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, darling," Anna replied, "you have been very silent for the
last minute or two, and then suddenly you said: 'The gipsy, the
gipsy,' twice, like that. It sounded so funny."</p>

<p>"I thought," Elza put in, "that perhaps you were afraid that the
dirty old gipsy had heard what we said. But gipsies in Hungary
don't speak English, you know. For one thing they never go to
school."</p>

<p>Elza appeared quite light-hearted now.</p>

<p>"I knew," she said, "that you would approve of my plan."</p>

<p>She said this, but Rosemary herself was quite unconscious that
she had spoken. She had dreamed and dreamed, and seen a motor-car
speeding along the dusty road. But through it all, she had
approved, approved of the plan. It was so feasible, and so simple.
She only wondered why Peter disapproved.</p>

<p>"What does Peter Blakeney say to all that?" she asked
presently.</p>

<p>"Peter?"</p>

<p>Elza asked wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"Yes. You told him about your plan, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"No! No!" Elza asserted firmly. "We have told no one but you.
Peter is going away. Why should we tell Peter?"</p>

<p>"I thought—" Rosemary murmured.</p>

<p>"It will be time enough to tell him," Anna put in gaily, "when
Philip and I turn up at the hotel at Hódmezö. Won't he be surprised
when he sees us?"</p>

<p>How strange it all was! Peter knew, since he spoke of a mad plan
in Elza's head, and begged Rosemary to dissuade her from it. Peter
knew, though no one had told him. Another mystery added to all
those which had of late filled Rosemary with such a torturing sense
of foreboding. Another mystery that seemed to surround Peter's
changed personality, that seemed a part of this new personality of
his, flippant and indifferent, so unlike the Peter she had
known.</p>

<p>Now she longed passionately for Jasper—dear, kind Jasper,
around whom there hung no mystery—the strong hand that would
guide her through this maze of intrigue which bewildered as much as
it terrified her. Fortunately her promise to Jasper had been kept.
With this new mystery about Peter that she vaguely dreaded, she
would have been racked with anxiety if she had confided in him. And
yet, how disloyal was this thought, this fear! Fear of Peter!
Mistrust of Peter! A very little while ago she would have staked
her soul that Peter was true, loyal, the soul of honour, an English
gentleman, an English sportsman! A Blakeney! A Scarlet Pimpernel of
to-day! What was there in the atmosphere of this unfortunate
country groaning under a foreign, hated yoke to taint his simple
soul with the foul breath of intrigue?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 21</h2>

<p>Walking across the lawn toward the château half an hour later,
Rosemary found herself once more laughing at her suspicions of
Peter. Peter!! Heavens above! what turn were her suspicions
taking?</p>

<p>Did she really believe for one moment that Peter was intriguing
with these crafty Roumanians for the undoing or the persecution of
his own kith and kin? The very thought was preposterous. The
suggestion untenable. Whatever Jasper might think, whatever he
might fear, she, Rosemary, was nothing but a traitor if she allowed
herself for one moment to harbour such thoughts of Peter.</p>

<p>He was changed, certainly he was changed. But between that and
Jasper's suspicions—! It was Jasper who had first put
thoughts into Rosemary's head by extracting that strange promise
from her. Not to talk to Peter. Not to discuss the situation with
Peter. Otherwise she would never for one moment—</p>

<p>Of course, of course, the thought was preposterous. Peter and
intrigue! Peter and crafty Machiavellism! Peter and a double game
he was ashamed to avow! Why, reason should have rejected the first
hint of such a possibility, even if loyalty did not.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Rosemary!"</p>

<p>Peter's voice brought Rosemary back to reality. She had wandered
up the veranda steps, hardly conscious of where she was. Thank
Heaven, after her musings she was able to look Peter loyally in the
face. He had his hands buried as usual in the pockets of his
trousers, and the inevitable cigarette between his lips. Rosemary
felt hot and tired; the sun had been baking the lawn while she
walked across it, and she had no parasol. With a contented little
sigh she sank into the basket chair that Peter pulled forward for
her.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said abruptly, "that they have been telling you
about the nonsense that's going on in their dear, silly heads."</p>

<p>And with a nod he indicated the summer-house where, against the
creeper-clad entrance, Elza's white dress gleamed in the sunshine.
Rosemary made no reply. Peter's words had somehow acted like a
douche of cold water upon her sense of rest and well-being. It was
true then! He did know. Though Elza and Anna had told him nothing,
he knew. How? Rosemary would have given worlds for the right to ask
him, but suddenly her promise to Jasper loomed before her with
paramount importance, and put a seal upon her lips.</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me?" Peter insisted.</p>

<p>Of course there was a simple explanation for the whole thing.
Those dear people, Elza, Maurus, even Anna, were not models of
discretion. Their voices were loud and penetrating, and, when they
were excited about any project or event, they would discuss it
here, there and everywhere at the top of their voices, and with a
total disregard of possible eavesdroppers. Peter's knowledge of
Elza's plans may have come about quite innocently. Rosemary was
quite sure it had come about innocently. But somehow she longed for
that perfect security and trust in Peter which she used to feel
even when he was most capricious and his love-making most
tempestuous. Why hadn't he told Elza that he knew? Why, instead of
discussing the plan over with Elza or one of the others, did he
feign ignorance with them, and suddenly elect to go away on an
obviously futile excuse?</p>

<p>Oh, how Rosemary hated all this mystery! And how she feared it!
And how, above all, she hated that promise which she had made to
Jasper, and which prevented her at this moment from having a
straight talk with Peter.</p>

<p>"So you won't tell me?" he reiterated, and his voice sounded
curiously harsh, quite different to his usual very pleasant,
musical tones. Peter had the voice of a musician. It was deep in
tone and beautifully modulated. Peter's voice had been one of the
things about him that had captivated Rosemary's fancy in the past.
Now, he spoke through his teeth, with that hateful cigarette in the
long holder held between the corners of his lips. Rosemary tried to
be flippant.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" she exclaimed, with a little broken laugh, "are you
trying to play the role of the heavy father, Peter, or of the
silent strong man? And now you are frowning just like the hero in
one of Ethel M. Dell's books. When are you going to seize me by the
wrist and whack me with a slipper?"</p>

<p>It was very easy to make Peter laugh. He was laughing now, and
the scowl fled for the moment from his face.</p>

<p>"Don't play the fool, Rosemary," he said in his slangy, boyish
way. "Tell me what Aunt Elza has been saying to you out here?"</p>

<p>"But you silly boy," she riposted, "There's nothing to
tell."</p>

<p>Back came the scowl on Peter's face, darker than before.</p>

<p>"So," he said curtly, "I suppose that you and Aunt Elza and Anna
have been discussing frocks for the past hour and a half."</p>

<p>"No, dear," she replied coolly, "only the arrangements for
to-morrow's ball."</p>

<p>Whereupon Peter said "Damn!" and swung round on his heel, as if
he meant to leave her there without another word. But for this move
of his Rosemary was unprepared. She did not want Peter to go. Not
just yet. She was perfectly loyal to him in her thoughts, and she
was irrevocably determined not to break her promise to Jasper, but
she was not going to let Peter go off to-day without some sort of
explanation. She might not see him again after this—for
weeks, for months, for years! So she called him back.</p>

<p>"Peter!" she cried.</p>

<p>He swung back and returned to her side. His deep, changeful
eyes, which at times were the colour of the ocean on the Cornish
coast, and at others recalled the dark tints of his Hungarian
ancestors, looked strangely resentful still. But as his glance
rested on Rosemary, wandered from her delicate face in the pearly
shadow of her garden hat, along the contour of her graceful shoes,
the resentful look fled. And Rosemary, glancing up, caught a
momentary flash of that soul-holding gaze which had taken her
captive that lovely night in June by the river, when she had lain
crushed and bruised in his arms, the gaze which that other night in
the Albert Hall box had filled her soul with abiding regret.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to tell you, Peter?" she asked in that
stupid way that comes to the lips when the soul is stirred and the
mind commands self-control.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he replied roughly, "that you don't want to."</p>

<p>"Peter," she retorted, "why are you so strange with me? One
would think I had done something to offend you. You scarcely will
speak to me; when you do you are so rough and so abrupt, as
if—as if—Oh, I don't know," she went on rapidly, and
her voice shook a little as she tried to avoid that memory
conjuring glance of his. "It seems as if something had come between
us, almost as if we were enemies."</p>

<p>Peter laughed at this, but his laugh sounded rather forced and
harsh.</p>

<p>"Enemies!" he exclaimed. "Good God, no!"</p>

<p>"But something has happened, Peter," she insisted. "I cannot
tell you how I find you changed."</p>

<p>"Well," he said curtly, "something did happen, you know, when
you married Jasper."</p>

<p>"I don't mean that, Peter. I saw you in London after I was
engaged, and you had not changed then. It is here—in this
place—that you seem so different."</p>

<p>"You must admit the place gets on one's nerves," he said with a
shrug.</p>

<p>"You must make allowances, Peter," she rejoined gently. "They
are in such trouble."</p>

<p>"Are they?" he retorted.</p>

<p>"Why, you know they are!" And her voice rang with a note of
indignant reproach. "How can you ask?"</p>

<p>"I ask because I don't know. You say that they—I suppose
you mean Aunt Elza and Maurus and the kids—are in trouble.
How should I know what you mean? Since I've been here they have
done nothing but shout, dance and make plans for more dancing and
shouting, and when I ask you anything you only tell me lies."</p>

<p>"Peter!"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, dear," he said with sudden gentleness. "I
didn't mean to be caddish. But you know," he went on, harshly once
more, "you did tell me that Jasper had gone to Budapest on
business."</p>

<p>"Well?" she queried.</p>

<p>"Well! Knowing you to be truthful by nature, I am wondering why
you should have told me such an unnecessary lie." Then, as Rosemary
was silent, he insisted: "Won't you tell me, Rosemary?"</p>

<p>"You are talking nonsense, Peter," she replied obstinately.
"There is nothing to tell."</p>

<p>"Which means that Jasper has told you—or
insinuated—that I am not to be trusted."</p>

<p>She protested: "Certainly not!"</p>

<p>"Then," he concluded, "the mistrust comes out of your own
heart."</p>

<p>"That again is nonsense, Peter. There is no question of trust or
mistrust, and I have no idea what you mean. It is you who try to
deceive me by feigning ignorance of what is going on in this house.
If Aunt Elza has not spoken openly with you, it certainly is not
for me to enlighten you. There," she added, as she caught a look of
eager questioning in his eyes, "I have already said more than I
have any right to say. Elza and Anna are coming across the lawn. If
you want to know anything more, you had better ask them."</p>

<p>And abruptly she rose and left him and went into the house. She
felt hurt and angry and not a little ashamed. She felt hurt with
Peter, angry with Jasper, and ashamed of herself. Peter was quite
right. She had told him lies—unnecessary lies. And Jasper had
forced her to tell them and to be disloyal to Peter. The present
situation was a false one. Utterly false. It was Peter who should
take over the direction of Elza's plan. With his help the chances
of Philip's and Anna's escape would be increased tenfold. It seemed
an awful thing—it was an awful thing—that he should be
shut out of Elza's councils, that he should go away on a futile and
trivial errand while those his own kith and kin were in such
terrible danger, and running into dangers that were worse
still.</p>

<p>For the last time the temptation returned, and with double
violence, to break her promise to Jasper and go straight back to
Peter and tell him everything. She paused in the centre of the
drawing-room and looked back through the wide-open glass doors.
Peter was still on the veranda. He had picked up a stick and a
tennis ball and was hitting the one with the other and humming a
tune. He caught Rosemary's eye as she glanced back to look at
him.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" he called gaily.</p>

<p>Rosemary went deliberately back to the glass door. She paused
under the lintel; then she said earnestly:</p>

<p>"Don't go to Hódmezö to-day, Peter. I am sure there is no
necessity for you to go. You can book rooms by telephone, and,
anyway—" She paused a moment and then went on more earnestly
still: "Wait another twenty-four hours, Peter. Don't go
till—till after the ball."</p>

<p>Peter did not look at her. He was taking careful aim with the
stick and the tennis ball. He made a swinging hit and watched the
ball fly away over the lawn. Then he threw the stick down and
turned to Rosemary.</p>

<p>"Sorry," he said lightly, "but I have promised."</p>

<p>She gave an impatient sigh, and after another second's
hesitation once more turned to go.</p>

<p>"I say," he called after her, "what about a game of tennis.
There's just time for a set before I need make a start."</p>

<p>But by now all temptation to talk openly with Peter had
vanished. What would be the use of telling this irresponsible boy
anything? Jasper was right. Elza was right. Only she, Rosemary, was
foolish, and her vaunted knowledge of human nature nothing but
vanity. She had only sufficient self-control left to call back
lightly to him:</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Peter, I am rather tired."</p>

<p>Then she fled precipitately out of the room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 22</h2>

<p>Rosemary did not see Peter again before he left. Somehow that
last vision which she had of him, hitting at a rubber ball with a
stick, and his utterly callous suggestion of a game of tennis at an
hour which he must have known was fateful to all his kindred, had
caused a revulsion in Rosemary's heart. She felt that never again
would she feel tempted to break her word to Jasper. Indeed, she
felt how right Jasper had been all along in insisting that she
should not discuss the grave events that affected the lives of all
the inmates of Kis-Imre with such a callous, empty-headed,
irresponsible young jackanapes as Peter had lately become.</p>

<p>So she had gone upstairs to her room, and with a curious
heartache, for which she was unable to account, she listened to the
familiar bustle and noise that always filled the château whenever
visitors came or went. Somehow she could not bring herself to say
"Good-bye" to Peter. Elza had told her that he would be coming back
within the next week or so, but Rosemary, who felt too tired for
introspection, could not have told you whether she was glad or
sorry at the prospect of seeing him again quite so soon.</p>

<p>The rest of the day, as well as the long, interminable evening,
were taken up with the discussion of household affairs—the
luncheon, the dinner, the ball, and even into these Philip and Anna
entered whole-heartedly and with apparent complete disregard of
what that fateful morrow might bring them. As for Elza, she was
perfectly marvellous! Kind, fussy as usual, her menus and the
airing of the guest-rooms being, to all appearances, the most
important matters in her mind.</p>

<p>After everyone had gone to bed little Anna came to Rosemary's
room and sat for a while beside her on the sofa, holding the
Englishwoman's hand as if she wished to transfuse through those
slender fingers strength and courage into her soul. When Rosemary
made a passing allusion to the wonderful stoicism that could allow
trivial matters to seem so important at a moment when life and
worse were at stake, Anna explained quite gently:</p>

<p>"We are made like that, we Hungarians. We hold our lives cheap,
I think, because throughout our history we have always had to
sacrifice them for our country. And also, I think, that we have a
certain Oriental fatalism in us. Not the fatalism of the Moslem,
who abdicates free will, but the faith of the Christian who
believes that God ordains everything and that it is useless to
fight his decrees."</p>

<p>"And yet you are not a religious people," Rosemary riposted,
thinking of what Elza had said to her the night before.</p>

<p>"Only in the sense that children are religious," Anna rejoined.
"We accept blindly what some kind nuns and ignorant priests have
taught us, and we believe in an Almighty God more absolutely and
ingenuously than the more thoughtful people of the West."</p>

<p>Long after Anna had gone Rosemary thought over what the child
had said. Well, perhaps it was true. There certainly was an
exquisitely beautiful passage in the New Testament where the Divine
Master enjoins his disciples to become as little children. And,
recollecting Anna's words, Rosemary caught herself wondering
whether the childlike faith of these people would not open the
Kingdom of Heaven more easily for them than would a more
considered, more rational religion—a compromise between a
very erring human reason and the Divine Mysteries which no human
thought could fathom.</p>

<p>As for the next day, it was just a whirl, a jumble of gaieties
and talk, of arrivals and merry greetings, of meals and tennis and
walks, and of talk, talk, talk and endless laughter. Rosemary, when
she rose, had made up her mind that she would just shed her real
personality for the whole of the day. She would cease to be
Rosemary with the aching heart, the soul rent by conflicting
duties, by anxieties, determination and sorrow; she would become
the "dear Lady Tarkington," the "Rosemary darling" of all these
kind, hospitable, wonderful people. She would laugh with them, play
with them and with them lay aside for the next few hours the
torturing anxiety of the day.</p>

<p>She would forget, she would laugh, she would talk. The effort
would do her good, and when the hour came when the fate of all
those she cared for would have to be decided, when on one word, one
smile, would perhaps hang the destiny of Philip and of Anna, then
she would be strong enough to play the part allotted to her in the
tragic farce—the farce that had found birth in the brain of a
heart-broken mother.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 23</h2>

<p>And it had been a wonderful day. The weather was perfect.
Everyone was in the highest possible spirits. The chef surpassed
himself; everyone pronounced the lobster à l'Américaine perfect and
the Charlotte Russe Créole quite inimitable.</p>

<p>All afternoon tennis balls were flying, and there was coffee,
ices and iced drinks going all day on the lawn. At five o'clock the
gipsy musicians from Bonczhida arrived, and after that music never
ceased. Rosemary learned something of gipsy endurance that day, for
this band of twelve musicians never left off playing form the
moment they arrived until—until midnight, when time ceased to
be and Fate began to swing her long pendulum.</p>

<p>But between five o'clock and midnight there was music, ceaseless
music. While the guests arrived, while everyone played tennis,
croquet, drank coffee, walked, flirted, dressed, dined and danced
there was music—music all the time.</p>

<p>After dinner the young Roumanian officers from the garrison at
Cluj came over in several motors. Among them were the eleven
cricketers, very proud of themselves, feeling quite English and
real sportsmen, delighted to have been chosen to play in the
historic match. Fine-looking young men, most of them, with the
unmistakable swaggering air of the conqueror about their whole
attitude towards the subject race. Elza was invariably a perfect
hostess; but Maurus, after a curt greeting, nursed his wrath in a
corner of the ballroom, surrounded by his own friends. He had been
drilled to keep his temper in check, and love for his own son,
anxiety for him and knowledge of danger gave him for this one
evening a certain amount of self-control. Rosemary admired him as
much as she did the others, for she knew what it cost Maurus to
have these alien conquerors in his house.</p>

<p>Anna's mother and sister had come over from Ujlak. The mother
was a hard woman, obviously selfish and unsympathetic. Her own
grievances, the confiscation of a great deal of her property,
seemed to have smothered every soft, womanly instinct in her.
Apparently she knew nothing of the danger that hung over her
daughter, and Rosemary had the feeling that if she had known she
would not greatly have cared. Her eyes, which were dark and set
very wide apart in a flat, colourless face, only softened once, and
that was when she spoke about her husband, who had died just before
the war.</p>

<p>As for persecutions, humiliations, petty tyrannies, she
dismissed them with a shrug of the shoulders. "The Roumanians are
the scum of the earth," she said in her quiet, unemotional manner,
through her thin, colourless lips, "just a horde of uneducated
peasantry; you can't expect anything from a pig but a grunt. I am
only thankful that Béla is not here to see it all."</p>

<p>On the other hand, the young people who filled the stately
château of Kis-Imre with their flutterings like an army of gaily
painted butterflies did not worry about political grievances. For
them the Roumanian officers were just dancing-partners, and their
worth was only measured by their proficiency in the latest steps.
The mammas and papas either played bridge or sat on the chairs that
were ranged against the walls all round the beautiful ballroom
placidly admiring the evolutions of their own progeny.</p>

<p>Rosemary, not to be outdone in self-discipline, was outwardly as
gay as any of them. She danced impartially with the Hungarians and
the Roumanians, and talked cricket knowledgeably with the team. For
her the atmosphere was electrical. At times it seemed to her
over-strained senses as if she could hear the whir of the
spinning-wheel driven by the Fates, the hum of the spindle, and the
click of their scissors as they made ready to cut the thread of
these people's destiny.</p>

<p>Just before midnight the young Roumanian officers who formed the
cricket team left in the two motor-cars which were to take them
direct to Hódmezö, a matter of ninety odd miles. Rosemary found
herself saying good-bye to them like an automaton—counting
them over as if they were ninepins. A kind of mist was before her
eyes through which their good-looking faces seemed to be grinning
at her, and their moustaches bristling like Alice's Cheshire
cat.</p>

<p>Elza, wonderful as ever, fussed around them, stuffing delicacies
into the cars at the last moment, fruit, bottles of wine, cakes,
chocolates, and lending them rugs and cushions.</p>

<p>"It is a long drive," she said, as she shook hands one by one
with the young officers, who clicked their heels together, jingled
their spurs and declared that they had had a very pleasant evening.
"You will be hungry when you get to Hódmezö," she added, "and all
the restaurants will be closed. You will be glad of a glass of wine
and some of my home-made cake."</p>

<p>Rosemary was standing next to Maurus Imrey at the time. She
heard him mutter between his teeth:</p>

<p>"And may it choke you when you eat and drink."</p>

<p>But even Maurus was wonderful. Wonderful! He shook hands. He
smiled—wryly; but he smiled. Wished them all God-speed. He
had been well drilled, and he was fully conscious of the danger to
Philip and Anna if he lost control over his temper now.</p>

<p>So he, too, gave directions for putting provisions into the
cars. He had four bottles of French red wine in his cellar and he
insisted that the young officers should have those. "It will make
them play that silly cricket better," he said. "And I hate the
stuff myself."</p>

<p>The four men who were going with the team as servants were there
arranging the rugs, stowing the wine and fruit and cake in the
cars. Rosemary knew the two sons of János, the miller, by sight.
They were fine, well-set-up young fellows, obviously of the stuff
that heroes are made of, for they were going to risk their lives
for the children of their feudal lords.</p>

<p>Anna, equally self-possessed, flitted among the guests like a
little fairy. She had on a pale blue dress, and out in the open her
slim figure was hardly distinguishable in the gloom; only her
small, white face told as if carved out of alabaster: that dear
little face, with the big eyes that were so like Peter's. When she
was saying good-bye to one of the young officers, who had been her
dancing-partner, she said with a pout:</p>

<p>"I think it was horrid of you to telephone to Peter Blakeney
yesterday and take him away from us. I don't believe you would have
had any difficulty with the hotel people about your rooms. And,
anyway, you might have let Peter have another day's enjoyment."</p>

<p>The young man appeared genuinely bewildered.</p>

<p>"Will the gracious lady deign to explain?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, there is nothing to explain," Anna said, with a light
laugh. "We were all of us very angry with you for sending that
telephone message which took Peter Blakeney away from us."</p>

<p>"But pardon me, dear lady," the officer rejoined, "we didn't
send any telephone message to Monsieur Blakeney. As a matter of
fact, we fully expected to find him here."</p>

<p>"But about your rooms—?" Anna insisted.</p>

<p>"Our rooms at Hódmezö have been arranged for ages ago.
Everything there is in perfect order and—"</p>

<p>"Anna, dear," Rosemary broke in quickly, "Peter didn't say who
sent him the telephone message. He only said that he had one. It
may have come from Hódmezö—from one of the hotel
people—he didn't say—"</p>

<p>What had prompted Rosemary to interpose at this moment she did
not know. It was just an instinct: the blind instinct to protect,
to shield Peter from something ugly and vague, that she had not yet
had time to see clearly, and Anna then went on lightly:</p>

<p>"Oh, of course he didn't say. Anyway, when you see Peter, tell
him he was very silly to go away, and that he missed a great deal
by not being here to-night. You can tell him that Marie never
danced so well in all her life, and the gipsies from Bonczhida
simply surpassed themselves."</p>

<p>Whereupon the young officer clicked his heels and promised that
he would deliver the message.</p>

<p>"But we shan't see Monsieur Blakeney," he said, "until the
evening. You know the match is not until Thursday. Monsieur
Blakeney arranged to meet us in Hódmezö on Wednesday evening, and
this is only Tuesday.</p>

<p>"It will be Wednesday morning before we start," one of his
friends broke in lightly, "if you don't hurry, you old
chatterbox."</p>

<p>After that, more "good-byes" and waving of hands as the
motor-cars rounded the courtyard and finally swung out of the
gates. Rosemary looked round to catch sight of Elza. She was quite
placid, and on her dear, round face there was a set smile.
Evidently she was unconscious of the fact that something stupendous
had happened, something that had hit Rosemary like a blow from a
sledge-hammer. No, no! Elza had not noticed. Elza's mind was no
longer here. It was way out upon the dusty road, watching a
motorcar travelling at full speed over the frontier away from this
land of bondage, to Hungary to freedom. Elza had noticed nothing.
Anna and Philip were still laughing and chattering, Maurus
muttering curses. No one had noticed anything. Only for Rosemary
had the world—her own beautiful world of truth and
loyalty—come to an end. Peter had lied. Peter was playing a
double game. It was no use arguing, no use hoping. The only thing
to do was to go on groping in this mystery that deepened and
deepened, until it became tangible, material like a thick, dark fog
through which glided ghouls and demons who whispered and laughed.
And they whispered and laughed because Peter had lied and because
she, Rosemary, saw all her hopes, her faith, her ideals lying
shattered in a tangled heap at her feet. Peter had lied. He had
acted a lie. He told her that he had promised to go to Hódmezö to
see about rooms for the cricket team. Well, that was not true.
Rosemary had interposed, made some excuse for Peter. She wouldn't
have those Roumanians think that Peter was a liar. They would have
smiled, suggested some amorous intrigue which Monsieur Blakeney
wished to keep dark. At the thought Rosemary's gorge rose, and she
put in a lame defence for Peter. But all the time she knew that he
had lied. If Peter did not go to Hódmezö yesterday, where was he
now? Why all this secrecy? These lies?</p>

<p>Why? Oh, God, why?</p>

<p>Rosemary had found a quiet corner in the hall where she could
sit and think for a moment. Yet thinking was the one thing she
could not do. Always, at every turn she was confronted with that
hideous query: Why had Peter lied? After a while she had to five up
trying to think. Fate's spindle was whirring, the scissors
clinking. She, Rosemary, a mere atom in the hands of Fate, must
continue to play her part.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour must have gone by while she
sat—trying to think—in the dark. Perhaps more. Anyway,
when she returned to the ballroom she found the company much
diminished in numbers. All the Roumanian officers had gone, also
one large party who lived just the other side of Cluj. Only a few
remained whose châteaux were too far away for a midnight start,
seeing that motors were forbidden to the conquered race. They were
going to spend the night at Kis-Imre, and probably make a start in
the morning. The young people had already resumed dancing; the
gipsies were playing the latest fox-trot. The mammas and papas were
placidly admiring their respective progeny.</p>

<p>All this Rosemary took in at a glance.</p>

<p>Then she looked round for Elza. But neither Elza nor Maurus was
there. And Philip and Anna had also gone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 24</h2>

<p>A few minutes later Elza came back. To Rosemary, who had been
watching for her by the door, she just whispered as she
entered:</p>

<p>"It is all right. They have gone."</p>

<p>She still was wonderful. Quite calm and with that set smile on
her face. Only her round, blue eyes had an unusual glitter, and the
pretty silvered hair clung matted against the smooth white brow.
Rosemary watched the scene, now entranced. She had never seen
anything like it. It did not seem reality at all. It could not be.
All these people here were just puppets and they were play-acting.
They could not have behaved as they did if they had been real.</p>

<p>There were no longer any Roumanians there. They were all
Hungarians together—just a few of them, all from
Transylvania, the wretched, occupied territory, in which everybody
was something of a slave, never allowed to forget for an instant
that they were the defeated, and that they must submit. All were
relatives or else very intimate friends. And after a while they
began to notice that Philip and Anna were not there. At first they
asked questions. Where were Philip and Anna? Elza said nothing. She
only gave an answering look here and there, a quiver of the eyelid
and certain setting of the lips. She did not say anything, but it
was remarkable how everybody understood.</p>

<p>Rosemary watched every face and knew that they understood. They
asked no more questions. They accepted the situation. Philip and
Anna had gone. They had to go as countless others, who had to fly
at dead of night, get the other side of the frontier as quickly as
possible, to escape from military tribunal, chicanery, persecution,
or even death.</p>

<p>It was late now, long past midnight. The gipsies had been sent
downstairs to get some supper. The mammas and papas declared that
it was time to go to bed. The young people thanked dear Aunt Elza
for such a happy time, the young men kissed her hand. One or two of
the older people whispered: "Good luck!" Others said reassuringly:
"Don't fret, they will be all right." Never a question about Philip
and Anna. Never a comment. They knew. They understood.</p>

<p>Orders were given for the carriages to be ready at nine o'clock
the next morning. With the innate delicacy that underlay so much
apparent pleasure-loving, they wished to relieve as soon as
practicable this house of sorrow from the burden of their
presence.</p>

<p>By half-past twelve ballroom, hall, reception-rooms, were all
empty. Elza waited downstairs till the last of the servants had
gone. Rosemary helped her at the last to put the gold service away
in the strong cupboard. It consisted of half a dozen pieces of
great artistic beauty and equally great value. Each piece had to be
wrapped up in cotton wool and green baize. Elza did it all, and
Rosemary could see that her podgy white hands did not tremble, and
that she put every piece away with her usual meticulous care. Only
when her task was accomplished and there was nothing more to do but
switch off the light did Elza's stoicism give way. She sank into a
chair, her head fell back against the cushions, and a leaden tint
spread over her cheeks and lips. Rosemary quickly poured some
brandy into a glass, and kneeling beside her tried to get her to
drink some of it. To please her, Elza sipped a few drops. A wan
smile spread over her face.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me, Rosemary darling," she said, "I am quite
well."</p>

<p>She jumped up at once and added: "I must see how poor Maurus
is."</p>

<p>"Come into my room afterwards," Rosemary suggested, "and rest
there on the sofa. I know you won't sleep."</p>

<p>"Yes," Elza replied, "I will come as soon as I can get Maurus to
sleep. I think he may get to sleep presently. But I don't think I
shall. You see, we ought to get a telephone message through from
Hódmezö the first thing in the morning. Philip and I agreed on a
code. If everything is all right he is to give Peter Blakeney's
name and say that the weather is beautiful in Hungary, and every
arrangement for the cricket match splendid. After I get that
message I shall probably sleep."</p>

<p>She had toiled up the stairs while she was talking, and Rosemary
followed close behind her, ready to catch her if she swooned.</p>

<p>"I won't say 'good night' now," Elza said when she near her
bedroom door. "You go to bed, Rosemary darling, and I will come in
presently for a little talk when Maurus is asleep."</p>

<p>Rosemary went into her room. She undid her hair and slipped into
a dressing-gown. It was no use going to bed; she knew she would not
be able to go to sleep. It was just a case of waiting. Of watching,
of praying, and commending those two young creatures to God.
Watching and praying, with eyes fixed upon the hands of the clock,
following in imagination every phase of to-nights adventures. Every
detail. At this hour they would be at the mill, all the actors in
the drama which poor Elza had invented. Philip and Anna would be
there, changing into peasant's clothes, and János the miller would
be setting out the mugs and the spirit, which would make the Jew's
son and the brother of the Roumanian storekeeper blind to the
world. Old Emma would be there too, the miller's wife, the mother
of the two boys who were going to risk so much for Philip's sake
and Anna's Emma would be fussing round with cloth and duster.
Grumbling and fussing. Knowing nothing of the drama on which the
curtain would ring up in the parlour of her cottage, and in which
her two sons would be playing leading roles. János would not have
told her. He, the father, had agreed to it all; had even suggested
it. But the mother? No! If she knew she would protest. Weep, of
course. Weaken the resolution of the two boys who just had to go
through with it all.</p>

<p>And now the motor would be drawing up at the mill, and János the
miller would ask the company to walk in and have a drink. Even the
motor-driver would be persuaded. Just a drop of spirit, as it was a
long drive all the way to Hódmezö. Time was moving leaden-footed up
here in the château. But not so at the mill, while János was
telling funny stories and plying his guests with drink.
Leaden-footed! My God! how slowly did those clock hands move! Only
half an hour gone by since Elza had switched off all the lights,
and the whole château was plunged in darkness, and every sound was
stilled.</p>

<p>So still! Only the ticking of the clock, and at times the click
of the scissors of Fate, ready to cut the thread of two young
lives—of more perhaps—if anything went wrong, if the
slightest mistake was made, if any one man proved disloyal—or
a liar.</p>

<p>Rosemary shuddered although the night was hot. She could not sit
still. At times she felt that she could not breathe. She went out
upon the balcony and listened. Listened. The air was so still that
she felt she must hear presently the whir of the motor when it made
a fresh start from the mill half a mile away. Far away on the
hillside a fox gave a cry, and from the old thatched barn close by
came the melancholy hoot of an owl.</p>

<p>Then the village church clock struck the half-hour. Half-past
one. More than an hour since Rosemary, going into the ballroom, had
noted that Philip and Anna were no longer there. In one of the
homesteads on the outskirts of the village a cock crew. In another
two hours dawn would be breaking, and the motor was to be in
Hódmezö before sunrise. And suddenly Rosemary heard right through
the stillness a crepitation and then a whir. And then the whirring
died away very gradually, and stillness reigned once more.
Absolute!</p>

<p>"They've started!"</p>

<p>It was Elza's voice close to Rosemary's elbow. Rosemary had not
heard her timid knock, and Elza had slipped into the room and now
stood by the open window, listening. The voice was quite calm, with
just a ring in it of exultation rather than excitement. Rosemary
took her hand. It was quite cold. She fondled it and warmed it
between her own.</p>

<p>There was a wicker chair on the balcony and some cushions.
Rosemary made Elza sit down, and then she piled up the cushions and
squatted on them at Elza's feet, fondling her hands and caressing
them by laying her young velvety cheek against them.</p>

<p>The night was exquisitely beautiful, with the waning moon
mysterious and honey-coloured in a firmament shimmering with stars.
In the borders the flowers slept, the evening primroses had folded
their golden petals, the scarlet pentstemons hidden their
brilliance in the gloom; only the heliotrope and the nicotiana
swung their censers, lazily sending their heady perfume through the
night, and the white tufted pansies shone like numberless tiny
mirrors, reflecting the stars.</p>

<p>"Did Maurus get to sleep?" Rosemary asked after a while.</p>

<p>"Yes," Elza replied. "I gave him a cachet of aspirin. It
quietened his nerves, and after a while he went to sleep."</p>

<p>"Won't you just close your eyes, Elza, and try to rest a little?
The night is young yet, and I am afraid you'll be ill if you don't
get a little rest. You've gone through so much!"</p>

<p>"Presently, darling," Elza said quietly. "I dare say I shall
drop to sleep, as I am very tired. But not just yet. I would like
to stay here a little longer—unless I am bothering you."
Then, as Rosemary gave her knees an affectionate hug, she went on
gently: "I love the smell of flowers in the night, don't you? They
smell quite differently from what they do in the daytime." And
presently she went on <i>à propos</i> of nothing at all:</p>

<p>"There is just one difficult place where the driver might miss
his way. That would delay them a little, but even so they should be
very near the frontier by now."</p>

<p>"Have you arranged to get any news?" Rosemary asked.</p>

<p>"Philip is to telephone from Hódmezö as soon as the office is
open."</p>

<p>"You won't hear before then?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I told János to say to the motor-driver that if he will
drive straight back here from Hódmezö there will be a thousand leis
for him, and if he gets here before eight o'clock then he will get
two thousand."</p>

<p>After the village church clock had struck three Elza became very
still, but Rosemary did not think that she was actually asleep. Her
hands were very cold, and her breath came and went more rapidly
than usual. Rosemary rose noiselessly to her feet, she got the
eiderdown from her bed and wrapped it round Elza's knees. Elza did
not move. Her pretty, round face showed very white in the light of
the waning moon, and all her hair seemed to have lost its golden
tint and shimmered like threads of silver.</p>

<p>Rosemary went back into the room and lay down on the sofa. The
air was very close, and she was very tired, so tired that she must
have fallen asleep. Presently something roused her and she opened
her eyes. The room was flooded with the golden light of dawn. She
jumped to her feet and went to the window. Elza was not on the
balcony; but Rosemary, looking over the balustrade, saw her on the
veranda about to descent the steps.</p>

<p>"Elza," she called down softly, "wait for me."</p>

<p>Elza nodded acquiescence, and Rosemary ran down-stairs just as
she was, in dressing-gown and slippers, with her hair all hanging
loosely round her shoulders. Elza had waited on the veranda for her
quite patiently; she linked her arm in Rosemary's.</p>

<p>"You were able to sleep a little, darling," she said. "I am so
glad."</p>

<p>"And what about you, Elza?" Rosemary retorted.</p>

<p>"Oh, I slept quite nicely," Elza replied in her quiet, simple
way, "until the dawn closed the eyes of the night one by one, and
the moon went down behind the old acacia trees."</p>

<p>"I quite forgot to look at the time," Rosemary rejoined.</p>

<p>"It was half-past four when I left your room. I went to have a
peep at Maurus. He is still asleep."</p>

<p>"Thank God for that. He will only wake to hear the good
news."</p>

<p>Rosemary could no longer keep the excitement out of her voice.
Another two or three hours and this terrible suspense would be
over. She hardly dared to look at Elza, for she felt the dear
creature's body quivering against hers. The first glance had shown
her Elza's face the colour of ashes, with swollen eyelids and red
hectic spots on her cheek-bones. But outwardly she was still quite
calm, and when together they reached the dew-wet lawn she threw
back her head and with obvious delight drank in the sweet morning
air.</p>

<p>"It is astonishing," she said, "that one should be able to sleep
when—when things happen like they did to-night."</p>

<p>"You were dog-tired, Elza, and the air was so wonderfully balmy
and soothing. I think," Rosemary went on gently, "that God sent
down a couple of his guardian angels to fan you to sleep with their
wings."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Elza assented with a tired smile.</p>

<p>"Do you feel like a walk, as far as the perennial border?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. I should love it. And we still have hours to
kill."</p>

<p>Already sounds of awakening village life filled the morning with
their welcome strains. The fox and the owl were silent, but two
cocks gave answer to one another, and from the homesteads and the
farms came a lowing and a bleating and a barking, the beasts
rousing the humans to activity and calling them to the work of the
day.</p>

<p>As Elza's and Rosemary's footsteps crunched the gravel of the
path, Mufti, the big sheep-dog, and Karo, the greyhound, came from
nowhere in particular, bounding across the lawn, and threw
themselves, in the exuberance of their joy, upon these two nice
humans who had shortened the lonely morning hours for them.</p>

<p>"Let's go and see the moss-roses," Rosemary suggested, "see if
they smell as sweet as they did in the night."</p>

<p>They walked on to the end of the perennial border, where two or
three clumps of moss-roses nestled at the foot of a tall crimson
Rugosa laden with blossom.</p>

<p>"Dear little things," Elza said. "They are my favourite flowers.
I like them so much better than all those wonderful new roses that
get the prizes at the horticultural shows."</p>

<p>She stooped to inhale the fragrance of the roses, and while she
was stooping a faint, very distant whirring sound became audible,
which grew in volume every moment. Just for the space of one second
Elza did not move; she remained just as she was, stooping and with
her face buried in the roses. Then she straightened out her fine
figure and grasped Rosemary's hand.</p>

<p>"The motor," she said huskily. "Let us go."</p>

<p>The end of the perennial border where they were was nearly a
quarter of a mile away from the house; and then there was the house
to get round, the courtyard to cross—The whirring grew louder
every moment, then slower, and then it ceased. The car had come to
a halt, but not in front of the gates, which were still closed.
Rosemary and Elza were in the courtyard with Mufti and Karo jumping
about them and getting in the way. The motor was not in sight.</p>

<p>"Down, Mufti! Karo, down!" Elza kept repeating mechanically.</p>

<p>She was rather breathless after that race across the garden.
Rosemary ran to the lodge to call Feri, the night-watchman, who had
the keys of the gate. He had heard the dogs barking and the voice
of the gracious countess, so he was on the doorstep wondering what
had brought the ladies out at this hour of the morning.</p>

<p>"Quick, Feri, open the gates!" Rosemary called to him.</p>

<p>It took Feri a few moments to get the keys to unlock the gates.
An eternity.</p>

<p>From the direction of the village there had come a loud cry,
followed after a few seconds by shouts and the sound of men
running. Running and shouting, and now and then another shrill
cry.</p>

<p>"Run ahead quickly, Feri," Rosemary whispered to the watchman.
"Quickly, see what it is."</p>

<p>She held Elza's hand in the tight clutch, and under her arm. But
even so Elza succeeded in breaking free, and while Feri ran on
ahead, she did not lag far behind. Past the thick clump of acacias,
the village street came in sight. At the end of it, a quarter of a
mile away, in front of the inn which was kept by the Jew, a
motorcar had come to a halt, and some half-dozen peasants stood
round it, gesticulating and arguing. Down the street, from one or
two of the cottages, men, women and children came running out to
see what was happening, and when they caught sight of the gracious
countess and the gracious foreign lady they paused, bewildered. The
gracious countess—at this hour in the village! Such a thing
had never happened before. The men doffed their hats, the women
hastily bobbed a curtsy, the children stood stock-still, finger in
mouth, staring. A few, bolder than the rest, ran forward to kiss
the ladies' hands. But Elza hastened on, seeing nothing, heeding
nothing, whilst Rosemary kept close by her side. Feri, as he drew
near to the inn, shouted to the people to make way. But as soon as
he came in close sight of the car he turned and hastened back to
Elza. He clasped his hands together and cried:</p>

<p>"Don't come, gracious countess. Don't come! It is nothing,
nothing, just an accident, a—"</p>

<p>Silently, with lips tightly pressed together, Elza pushed past
him, but Rosemary now had once more taken hold of her hand. She
held Elza tight, with one arm round her waist and the other
clutching her hand. Struggle as she might, Elza could not free
herself this time.</p>

<p>The next moment they stood together by the side of the motor. It
was a large, rather shabby touring car, painted a dull grey and
fitted with leather cushions. It was smothered in dust. There was
no one in the back seats, but the innkeeper was just in the act of
climbing in beside the chauffeur. The chauffeur appeared to be
asleep; he sat like a huddled-up heap, wrapped in a dirty, military
coat, and with his peaked cap pulled down over his face. The
innkeeper appeared rather scared. He took hold of the military coat
and pulled it open, and immediately he clapped his hand to his
mouth, smothering a scream. The cap rolled off the chauffeur's
head, and his right arm dropped down the side of the car. One man
who stood quite near, not knowing probably that the two ladies were
there, cried excitedly:</p>

<p>"God in heaven! The man has been shot-dead!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 25</h2>

<p>There was no one there quite so self-possessed as Elza. Even
Rosemary had some difficulty in smothering a cry. The innkeeper
jumped down from the seat as if he had been driven away by a whip;
the peasants gesticulated and jabbered in an undertone. Rosemary
looked at Elza and clutched her hand more tightly against her own
body. Elza's face was the colour of lead, her lips looked purple,
even her large, blue eyes appeared colourless. Her hand was as cold
as ice and shook in Rosemary's strength-giving clasp. But to the
eyes of all these peasants and subordinates she appeared perfectly
calm, and after a moment or two she turned to the group of
jabbering, gesticulating peasants and asked quite quietly:</p>

<p>"Which of you first saw the motor draw up?"</p>

<p>"I heard the noise, gracious countess," the Jew volunteered, "as
the car drew up outside the door, and—"</p>

<p>"And I saw the soldier jump down," a young labourer broke in
excitedly. "He ran—"</p>

<p>"Very well," Elza said coldly. "Now you, and you," she went on
and pointed to the innkeeper and to the labourer, "come inside and
tell me what you have seen. Will you come, too, darling?" she asked
Rosemary.</p>

<p>Finally she turned to her own man Feri:</p>

<p>"One of you," she said, "had better go to the gendarmerie. They
ought to have been here by now."</p>

<p>Then she went into the inn; the Jew and the labourer followed,
and the peasants, having looked their fill at the car, or else
scared by that lifeless bundle in the chauffeur's seat, crowded
together in the doorway of the inn. But Rosemary lagged behind for
a moment, examining the car as if she expected the huge, shabby
thing to yield up the key of its own mystery. But in the body of
the car there was nothing, except the cushions and the dust and the
huddled figure of the dead chauffeur, with the head fallen forward
on the breast, and the arm hanging over the side of the car.
Rosemary turned away from it at first with a shudder, but almost
despite her will her eyes turned back to gaze again at that
huddled-up heap and the limp arm, from beneath the coat-sleeve of
which a thin filet of blood trickled drop by drop to the
ground.</p>

<p>And suddenly something white and crisp fell from the lifeless
hand into the dust at Rosemary's feet. She stooped and picked it
up. Fortunately the jabbering peasants were not looking this way,
and Feri had walked off to the gendarmerie. What Rosemary had
picked up was a letter addressed to "Lady Tarkington." She tore
open the envelope and read:</p>

<p>"A very clumsy attempt, dear lady. As you see, it has led to no
good. Your two protégés are now under my direct care, and you have
little more than a fortnight in which to write the newspaper
articles which I want."</p>

<p>The letter was signed "Naniescu." Rosemary slipped it into the
pocket of her gown, and then she went into the inn. The peasants
all made way for her, and then crowded again in the doorway, trying
to hear what was going on. Rosemary thought the long, low room one
of the stuffiest and most evil-smelling places she had ever been
in. It was very dark, the light only feebly penetrating through two
tiny, impracticable windows, the panes of which were covered in
dust. The only breath of fresh air that could possibly find its way
in would have been through the door, but that was blocked now by a
solid bundle of perspiring humanity. From the low raftered ceiling
hung strings of onions and maize, and in a corner of the room, on a
low table which was apparently used as a counter, were numerous
bottles and a number of pewter mugs. The odour in the room was a
mixture of dirt, onions and silvorium. But Elza, who sat beside the
table with the innkeeper and the peasants before her, appeared
quite unconscious of smells or dirt. She was questioning the
labourer, who apparently was the only man who had actually
witnessed the arrival of the motor-car into the village.</p>

<p>"I saw it come, gracious countess," he said, with obvious pride
in his own importance, "and I saw it draw up outside here. There
was a soldier sitting near the chauffeur."</p>

<p>"And he was in the driving seat?" Elza asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, gracious countess, the soldier was driving when I first
saw the car come along the road."</p>

<p>"And the other man?"</p>

<p>"Well, gracious countess, I saw a sort of heaped-up bundle
beside the chauffeur. I did not know there was another man."</p>

<p>"Well, then what happened?"</p>

<p>"The car slowed down, gracious countess, and drew up outside
here. Then the soldier jumped up; he stepped over the heaped-up
bundle and got out of the car."</p>

<p>"Yes, and then?"</p>

<p>"He took the thing which I thought was just a bundle covered
with a military coat, and pushed it into the driver's seat. After
that he ran away as fast as he could."</p>

<p>"In which direction?"</p>

<p>"Where he had come from, gracious countess. There was another
car waiting for him there about half a kilometre away."</p>

<p>"Another car?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I didn't see it come, but I heard it slow down and come to
a halt. The soldier ran all the way. He jumped into that other car,
and it drove away in the direction of Cluj."</p>

<p>After that another man stepped in from the doorway and
volunteered the information that he had seen the second car
standing about half a kilometre away. He had seen the soldier
running, and had seen the car drive off. He thought there was
another soldier in that car.</p>

<p>By that time a couple of gendarmes were on the scene. They were
conducting their own investigations of the case in a casual,
perfunctory manner. At first they took no notice of Elza or of
Rosemary, talked over their heads in a proper democratic manner;
then one of them asked curtly of Elza:</p>

<p>"Did you see the car drive up?"</p>

<p>Elza said: "No!"</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about it?"</p>

<p>Again she replied: "No!"</p>

<p>Whereupon the man queried roughly: "Then what are you doing
here?"</p>

<p>Elza's face flushed a little, but she replied quite courteously:
"We all hoped at the castle to hear that the miller's two sons had
arrived safely at Hódmezö, and I thought that this was the car that
drove them in the night."</p>

<p>The man gave a sneer and a shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>"You seem mightily concerned," he said, with a harsh laugh,
"about the miller's sons, to be out of your bed at this hour of the
morning."</p>

<p>He spat on the ground, turned on his heel, and once more
addressed the peasants.</p>

<p>"Now, then," he said, quite genially, "all of you get back to
your homes. The Government will see about this affair, and it is no
concern of anybody's. Understood?"</p>

<p>The two gendarmes waved their arms and drove the people out of
the inn and away from the door as if they were a flock of sheep.
They obeyed without murmur, only with an occasional shrug of the
shoulders, as much as to say: "Well, well, these are strange times,
to be sure! But it is no concern of ours."</p>

<p>The gendarmes then went out of the inn. They moved the body of
the dead chauffeur into the body of the car; one of them got in
beside it, the other took the driver's seat, and the next moment
the mysterious car had disappeared up the village street in the
direction of the gendarmerie.</p>

<p>When the last of the crowd had dispersed, Elza rose and,
white-faced, wide-eyed, she turned to Rosemary.</p>

<p>"There is nothing more," she said, "that we can do here. Shall
we go home?"</p>

<p>She nodded to the Jew, and, leaning heavily on Rosemary's arm,
she went out into the street. It was past six now, and the village
was flooded with sunlight. Elza's tired, aching eyes blinked as she
came out into the open. Rosemary would have put an arm round her to
support her, for she felt that the poor woman was ready to swoon;
but mutely and firmly Elza refused to be supported. Her pride would
not allow her, even now, to show weakness in sight of these
cottages, behind the windows of which the eyes of Roumanian
peasants might be on the look-out for her.</p>

<p>"They are outwardly obsequious," she said, as if in answer to a
mute remark from Rosemary. "Call me gracious countess and kiss my
hand, but at heart they hate us all, and triumph in our
humiliation."</p>

<p>Strange, wonderful people! Even at this hour of supreme anxiety
and acute distress, pride of caste fought every outward expression
of sorrow and conquered in the end. Elza walked through the village
with a firm step and head held quite erect. It was only when she
was inside the gates of her own home that she spoke, and even then
her first thought was for her husband.</p>

<p>"How to break the news to Maurus!" she murmured under her
breath. "My God, how to break the news."</p>

<p>In the hall, where Rosemary saw that they were quite alone, she
put her arms round Elza and drew her down into a low-cushioned
seat.</p>

<p>"Elza, darling," she said gently, "have a real cry, it will do
you good."</p>

<p>Elza shook her head.</p>

<p>"It won't bring Philip back," she said dully, "nor Anna. Will
it?"</p>

<p>Her big, round eyes gazed with pathetic inquiry into Rosemary's
face. She seemed to have some sort of intuition that her English
friend could help—that she could do something for Philip,
even now. Rosemary, her eyes swimming in tears, slowly shook her
head. And with a low moan, Elza buried her face in the cushions,
convulsive sobs shook her shoulders, and little cries of pain broke
intermittently from her lips. Rosemary made no attempt to touch
her. She let her cry on. Perhaps it was for the best. There was
nobody about, and tears were sometimes a solace. The quietude, the
stoicism of the past two hours, had been unnatural, racking alike
to heart, nerves and brain. There was a limit to human endurance,
and Elza had reached it at last.</p>

<p>When the worst of the paroxysm was over, Rosemary suggested
gently: "Would you like me to break the news to Maurus? I'll do it
most carefully, and I am afraid the strain would be too much for
you."</p>

<p>But already Elza had struggled to her feet. She was wiping her
eyes, then breathing on her handkerchief and dabbing them with
it.</p>

<p>"No, no, my dear," she said between the dry, intermittent sobs
that still shook her poor weary body, "not on any account. I
understand Maurus. I know just what to say. Poor, poor Maurus! He
has so little self-control. But I shall know what to say. You go
and get your bath now, darling," she went on, gently disengaging
herself from Rosemary's arms, "and get dressed. It will refresh
you. I will do the same before I speak to Maurus. Rosa shall bring
your coffee in half an hour. Will that do?"</p>

<p>She forgot noting, thought of everything—Rosemary's bath,
her breakfast, the guest. Ah, yes, the guests! Rosemary had
forgotten all about them. It was long past six now; they would soon
be up. All of them wanting breakfast, baths, attention. Elza forgot
nothing. Thank God that she had so much to think about!</p>

<p>"You go up, darling," she said to Rosemary. "I shall be quite
all right. Don't worry about me."</p>

<p>One or two servants came through the hall, busy with their work.
Elza had something to say, some order to give to all of them.</p>

<p>"Tell the chef," she said to Anton, "to come and speak to me
here. And don't go into the gracious count's room until I call
you."</p>

<p>Rosemary lingered in the hall a moment or two longer, until the
chef, in immaculate white, tall linen cap in hand, came for his
orders. Elza immediately entered into a long conversation with him
on the subject of milk rolls for breakfast. And Rosemary at last
went slowly up the stairs. Almost without knowing it, she found
herself once more in her room, the pretty, old-fashioned room with
the huge bedstead and the curtains embroidered in cross-stitch. How
pretty it looked, and how peaceful! Through the open window came
the sound of bird-song; a blackbird was whistling, a thrush was
singing, a hundred sparrows were chirruping, and on the large lily
leaves on the ornamental lake a frog was sitting croaking. So
peaceful, so still! And, heavens above, what a tragedy within these
walls!</p>

<p>For a while Rosemary stood at the open window gazing out upon
the beautiful panorama laid out before her, the prim, well-kept
garden the flower borders, the shady park, and out, far away, the
wooded heights, the forests of oak and pine which the morning sun
had just tinted with gold.</p>

<p>And with a sudden impulse Rosemary fell on her knees, just where
she was, at the open window, and she stretched out her arms towards
the Invisible, the Unattainable, the Almighty, and from her heart
there came a cry, forced through her lips by the intensity of
despair:</p>

<p>"Oh God! My God! Tell me what to do!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 26</h2>

<p>If Rosemary had been gifted with second sight!</p>

<p>She would have seen at the moment when she, in despair, turned
to the great Healer for comfort, General Naniescu and his friend M.
de Kervoisin enjoying their petit déjeuner in one of the palatial
rooms of the Imrey's house in Cluj. M. de Kervoisin had arrived the
night before. He was the guest of the general, and after a night's
rest was enjoying the company of his host, as well as the luxury of
these beautiful apartments so thoughtfully placed at the disposal
of the military Governor of Transylvania by the Roumanian
Government.</p>

<p>M. de Kervoisin was also enjoying the anxieties to which his
friend was a prey in his capacity of Governor of this unruly
country. There is something in a friend's troubles that is not
altogether displeasing to a philosopher. And M. de Kervoisin was a
philosopher. He had come over to give advice to his friend, and the
role of adviser in a difficult situation was one which he knew how
to fulfil with infinite discretion and supreme tact. Just now,
while sipping a cup of most excellent <i>café-au-lait</i>, he
listened with every mark of sympathy to Naniescu's account of the
terrible trouble he was having with a certain obstinate lady
journalist who would not do what he wanted.</p>

<p>"I have only asked her," he lamented, "for a few articles to be
published in The Times which would put us right with the British
and American public; but you know what women are. They never see
farther than their noses. And this one, damn her, is like a mule.
So far I have not been able to move her."</p>

<p>He had finished his breakfast, and with a pungent havana between
his fingers, was waving his podgy, hairy hands to emphasize his
words.</p>

<p>Kervoisin smiled. "And you want those newspaper articles?" he
asked. "Seriously?"</p>

<p>"Seriously," Naniescu assented. "My Government has become
suspicious. They are treating me very badly, you know. They began
by giving me a free hand. 'No more plottings and counter-plottings
in Transylvania,' they said to me when they sent me out here. 'It
is your business to see that things work smoothly out there. How
you do it is your affair.' Well," the general went on in an
aggrieved tone, "you would construe that order into a free hand for
me, would you not?"</p>

<p>M. de Kervoisin carefully spread butter on a piece of excellent
fresh roll before he answered: "Yes, I think I should."</p>

<p>"Of course," Naniescu retorted; "so would anyone. And I was
doing very well, too, until that young fool Imrey managed to send
his newspaper articles over to England. And at once my Government
got restive. You know those articles were pretty hot!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. But I always thought you attached too much
importance to them. Mon Dieu! Confiscations, perquisitions, arrests
and even executions, they are the inevitable consequences of
foreign occupation." And M. de Kervoisin took a little honey with
his bread and butter, and poured himself out another cup of coffee.
"And you know," he went on with a shrug, "the British and American
public are really very indifferent to what goes on out here. Cluj
is such a long way from London or New York. For a time the public
is interested, a few are indignant, one or two make a fuss and ask
questions in their Parliament, but, after all, you are one of the
Allies; you must not be too openly criticized. The man who asks
uncomfortable questions in Parliament is rebuked: <i>et puis
voilà</i>!"</p>

<p>"I know all that," Naniescu rejoined with some impatience, "but
unfortunately my Government does not think as you do. Their vanity
suffers when they are attacked in English newspapers, and then they
vent their spleen on me."</p>

<p>M. de Kervoisin said nothing for a moment or two; then he
remarked blandly: "I think I understand the
position—now."</p>

<p>"There is a talk of my resignation," the general added
curtly.</p>

<p>M. de Kervoisin smiled. "And you don't want to resign?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Of course not. Five thousand sterling a year; it is a fortune
in this miserable country; and then there are the perquisites."</p>

<p>M. de Kervoisin had finished his breakfast. He pushed his cup
and plate on one side, and resting both his elbows on the table,
looked intently at his friend, while a sarcastic smile curled round
his thin lips.</p>

<p>"So," he said, "you imagined this little scheme for putting
yourself right before your Government—and before the
world—by getting the beautiful Uno to write glowing accounts
of your marvellous administration of Transylvania, for the benefit
of English and American readers? Is that it?"</p>

<p>"Well, wouldn't you?" Naniescu retorted.</p>

<p>"Yes. But you are not succeeding, my friend," M. de Kervoisin
added with the suspicion of a sneer. "What?"</p>

<p>"I shall succeed in the end," Naniescu rejoined. "With the help
of my friend—" But at this point he was silenced by a
peremptory gesture of his friend's hand.</p>

<p>"S-sh!" de Kervoisin broke in quickly. "I shouldn't mention his
name—not even here."</p>

<p>"Oh, we are safe enough."</p>

<p>"Walls have ears, my friend," the other riposted, "even in this
perfectly administered land. And our friend's work would be futile
if his identity was suspected. I introduced him to you as Number
Ten. Number Ten let him remain."</p>

<p>"I suppose I can trust him," Naniescu mused. "You assured me
that I could. But bah!" he added with a contemptuous shrug. "Can
one trust those English?"</p>

<p>"You can trust this one," Kervoisin retorted curtly. "He was the
best spy we had during the war."</p>

<p>"During the war—yes! The man might think he was serving
the entire Allied cause by serving you. But now! And here! Frankly,
I don't understand the man's motive. He is rich, well born, and he
is playing a terribly risky game for us, who are nothing to
him."</p>

<p>"He is not running terrible risks for you, my friend, don't you
worry," de Kervoisin retorted with a mocking smile. "Though he may
have reasons which we don't know for hating the Hungarians, he
certainly has none for loving you; and you are one of the Allies,
and to a large section of the British public his work would not be
called very heinous, seeing that it is in your service and directed
against ex-enemies. However, let that pass. I attribute to Number
Ten a very different motive for his actions than the mere desire of
serving you."</p>

<p>"And what is that?"</p>

<p>"Money, for one thing. He is not as rich as you think, and has
extravagant tastes. But that is not all. I know the English better
than you do, my friend, and I can tell you that Number Ten would
just call his work sport; and for sport,
adventure—what?—a certain type of Englishman will do
anything, dare anything, risk everything. A hundred and fifty years
ago they had their Scarlet Pimpernel, who gave the Revolutionary
Government of France a deal of trouble at the time. Now they have
their Number Ten. The same spirit animates this man that animated
the other—one for good, the other, perhaps, for evil. Just
the spirit of adventure. A cycle of years has woven a halo of
romance round the personality of the Scarlet Pimpernel, and to us
Number Ten still appears as sordid, just a miserable paid spy in
the service of an alien Government. But believe me that many
Englishmen and even women will forgive him when they know him for
what he is, because they will put it down to a love of
adventure—to sport, which is the only motive the English
appreciate."</p>

<p>He took his cigarette-case out of his pocket, carefully selected
a cigarette, thrust it between his lips and lighted it. All the
while Naniescu had remained thoughtful. "You may be right," he said
finally. His was not an analytical mind; he was quite content to
accept de Kervoisin's explanation of the mystery that had vaguely
puzzled him; and, anyway, he did not care. Whatever motive animated
the mysterious spy, the man was very useful, and in the matter of
Philip Imrey and Anna Heves and of the obstinate lady journalist he
had had one or two brilliant ideas.</p>

<p>De Kervoisin smoked on in silence for awhile, then he said:</p>

<p>"Our friend does not seem to be coming. I hope there has been no
hitch."</p>

<p>"There could be no hitch," Naniescu asserted. "But it is two
hours' drive to Kis-Imre and two hours back here. Will you wait a
moment?" he went on, and rose to his feet. "I'll see if they've any
news downstairs in the office. I told Number Ten to telephone from
Kis-Imre when he got there."</p>

<p>Downstairs in the office they had nothing definite to report. No
message had come through from Kis-Imre. But even whilst Naniescu
was storming and fuming, blaming his subordinates, who obviously
were not responsible for the delay, a man wrapped, despite the
heat, in a huge stained and worn military coat, and wearing a
soiled <i>képi</i>, crossed the courtyard from the direction of the
entrance gates towards the principal staircase of the house.
Naniescu saw him from the window and ran out into the hall. He met
the man just as he was entering the house, and at once greeted him
with the greatest effusion.</p>

<p>"Is everything all right?" he asked hurriedly.</p>

<p>"All right," the man answered curtly. "Of course."</p>

<p>"Kervoisin is upstairs," Naniescu went on. "Come and tell us all
about it."</p>

<p>He ran upstairs two at a time; the man in the military coat
followed more slowly.</p>

<p>"Here is Number Ten," Naniescu announced, as he ushered the man
into the room where Kervoisin was patiently waiting and smoking
cigarettes. Kervoisin rose at once, a word of welcome on his lips.
But at sight of the man he paused and frowned, obviously mystified,
until gradually his face cleared and he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Bon Dieu! I should never have known you."</p>

<p>"I do look a disgusting object, don't I?" the man retorted. He
shook hands cordially with Kervoisin; then he threw off his heavy
coat and sank, obviously exhausted, into a chair.</p>

<p>"A cup of coffee?" Naniescu suggested.</p>

<p>"Thanks!" the other replied.</p>

<p>He drank the coffee, then took a cigarette from the case which
de Kervoisin offered him. He looked a regular vagrant, with face
and neck stained both with grease paint and with grime, his hands
were soiled with motor grease, and his hair hung lank and matted
into his eyes. He had what looked like a two weeks' growth of beard
on his chin and upper lip, and his clothes—if indeed what he
wore could be called clothes—were a mere bundle of rags.</p>

<p>"Number Ten," de Kervoisin said with conviction, "you are an
artist. I have seen our friend here," he went on, turning to
Naniescu, "in any number of disguises, but never two alike, and
every new one a surprise!"</p>

<p>"You flatter me, sir," Number Ten said with an almost
imperceptible sneer.</p>

<p>"But I am afraid you must be very tired," de Kervoisin resumed
affably. "I told the general last night that he might just as well
have sent one of his subordinates on this errand."</p>

<p>"I like to finish my work myself," Number Ten rejoined
curtly.</p>

<p>Whereupon Naniescu threw up his hairy, fat hands and exclaimed
in wonderment:</p>

<p>"<i>Ils sont impayables, ces Anglais!</i>"</p>

<p>"Then we may take it," de Kervoisin went on, "that the work is
finished?"</p>

<p>"Yes, finished," Number Ten replied. "We spotted the car on the
road about five kilometres from Cluj. The patrol summoned the
driver to stop, but the man had obviously had his orders; he
swerved sharply to the right and put on speed to try and rush
through, so I shot him."</p>

<p>"Ah! these English," Naniescu exclaimed complacently; "they are
wonderful!"</p>

<p>But de Kervoisin only expressed the mildest possible surprise by
a very slight lifting of his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Yourself?" was all he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," the other replied. "The patrol was on the other side of
the road, but I guessed what would happen, so I had brought my
horse to a halt about two hundred metres higher up."</p>

<p>"And," Naniescu asked blandly, "you killed the chauffeur?"</p>

<p>"Of course," the other sneered. "I was not likely to miss him,
was I?"</p>

<p>But Naniescu could only smile, and sigh, and murmur: "Oh, those
English! <i>Voyez—moi çà!</i>"</p>

<p>"There were two men in the body of the car," Number Ten
continued coolly, "they were dead drunk. Philip Imrey and the girl
were on the front seats. I gave my horse in charge of the patrol
and took the wheel. We were in Cluj outside the gaol soon after two
o'clock. I saw the chief superintendent and gave the three men and
the girl in his charge."</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes!" Naniescu broke in glibly, and turned to de
Kervoisin, "he had all instructions. Everything was ready. I have
seen him since. Philip Imrey and Anna Heves are in separate cells,
and the two drunken oafs he dispatched by train to Hódmezö. They
did not seem to know what had happened, and it was no use detaining
them."</p>

<p>"None whatever," Number Ten said dryly. "They were just drunken
oafs, as you say. With the miller and his two sons you will have to
deal presently—that is, if your second patrol succeeded in
capturing the sons. I couldn't be in two places at once, and they
may have crossed the frontier. Anyway, that's your affair, not
mine."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," Naniescu said airily. And de Kervoisin
put in rather impatiently:</p>

<p>"What about the car and the dead chauffeur?"</p>

<p>"I drove both out to Kis-Imre," Number Ten replied deliberately.
"The best way to let people there know what had happened. The
General agreed to it."</p>

<p>"Was that your brilliant idea?"</p>

<p>"Mine!" Number Ten replied curtly.</p>

<p>And suddenly through the paint and the grime a look of almost
inhuman cruelty distorted his face: the thin lips drew back tight
above the red gums, and the sharp teeth gleamed white like those of
a wolf. It was the recollection of a note which Naniescu had
scribbled at his dictation, and which he, Number Ten, had thrust
into the hand of the dead chauffeur for the perusal of an obstinate
woman, that brought that wolf-like look into his face. His eyes
almost disappeared beneath the strand of false eyebrows and the
thick layers of paint upon the lids, and his hands opened out and
were clutched again like the talons of a bird of prey.</p>

<p>For the space of a second or two Number Ten looked hideous. De
Kervoisin, who was watching him, was conscious of an uncomfortable
shudder: Naniescu fortunately was looking another way, and the
whole episode was over in a moment; the next, Number Ten was once
more leaning back in his chair, looking weary, grimy and
ill-tempered, but there was nothing supernatural about him, except
perhaps his amazing change from one personality to another.</p>

<p>"How did you get back here?" Kervoisin asked after a moment's
pause.</p>

<p>I have a car which our friend the general has placed at my
disposal, with a soldier-driver. I ordered him to follow me to
within half a kilometre of Kis-Imre."</p>

<p>"No one stopped you?"</p>

<p>"No one."</p>

<p>"I suppose you got to Kis-Imre before anyone was astir?"</p>

<p>"I won't say that. The ladies at the château were astir."</p>

<p>"And they saw you?"</p>

<p>"No. I had reached my own car, and was on the point of driving
off when I saw them coming through the gates of the château."</p>

<p>"You would not have liked them to see you, I imagine," Naniescu
put in with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"They wouldn't have known me," Number Ten retorted quietly.</p>

<p>"<i>Heu! heu!</i>" the general rejoined with a shrug. "There are
certain eyes that are reported to be very sharp."</p>

<p>"Anyway," Number Ten broke in coolly, "no one saw me except an
oaf from the village, so why discuss the point?"</p>

<p>And strangely enough General Naniescu, usually so dictatorial
and so arrogant, did not seem to resent the gruffness of this man
who was in his pay. On the contrary, he laughed good-humouredly and
rested his fat hand with a gesture of almost affection on the
shoulder of the spy.</p>

<p>"<i>Ah, ces chers 'Anglais!</i>" he sighed fatuously whilst de
Kervoisin turned quite politely to Number Ten with the bland
question: "And what is your next move, my dear friend?"</p>

<p>"To get those articles out of the fair Uno," Naniescu interposed
hurriedly before the other had time to reply. "That point must not
be lost sight of."</p>

<p>"I am not likely to lose sight of it," the other riposted dryly,
"seeing that I am to get ten thousand pounds sterling for them. I
suppose you think they are worth it?" he added, turning with his
habitual sneer to Naniescu.</p>

<p>"I think," the general replied slowly, "that with the arrest of
Philip Imrey and Anna Heves, which, when it becomes known, will
deter other young fools from playing the same game—with that,
I say, as a make-weight, I think the articles will be worth the
money—to my Government and to me."</p>

<p>"Well," Number Ten rejoined coolly, "I shouldn't have done your
dirty work for less."</p>

<p>And Naniescu once more gave a fatuous sigh and murmured:</p>

<p>"<i>Ils sont impayables, ces Anglais!</i>" whilst de Kervoisin
smiled as a philosopher smiles on follies and stupidities with
which he has no concern. Then he asked Number Ten: "And when do you
return to civilization, my friend—to decent clothes and a
bath?"</p>

<p>"At once," the other replied, "unless I am wanted for something
else."</p>

<p>"No, no, my dear man," the general rejoined, with perfect
affability. "I am quite content to leave everything in your
hands."</p>

<p>"And when do you want those articles?"</p>

<p>"Shall we say within the week?</p>

<p>"You shall have them," Number Ten said coolly as he rose from
his chair. He nodded to Kervoisin, who responded cordially: "<i>A
bientôt, mon ami!</i>" Then he turned to go; but already Naniescu
was on his feet.</p>

<p>"I'll escort you," he said hospitably, "in case you meet anyone
on the stairs. In your present get-up," he added with his oily,
guttural laugh, "it might be awkward."</p>

<p>"Thank you," the other assented coolly, and, gathering up the
dirty old military coat, he strode to the door. Naniescu was
already there, holding it open for him.</p>

<p>"You will stay and have lunch with M. de Kervoisin and me, I
hope," he said.</p>

<p>"I think not, thank you," the other replied.</p>

<p>"Ah! You are going to Hódmezö, perhaps—or to
Kis-Imre?"</p>

<p>And Number Ten replied, with his habitual curtness:</p>

<p>"That is my affair."</p>

<p>De Kervoisin, who still sat smoking, chuckled at this. A scene
such as this was part of a philosopher's enjoyment. Naniescu threw
him a look, and shrugged his shoulders. De Kervoisin could almost
hear him reiterating his stock phrase: "<i>Ils sont impayables, ces
Anglais!</i>"</p>

<p>After that the two men went out of the room and de Kervoisin
remained, sitting and smoking, with a thin smile on his colourless
lips—the smile of a philosopher who sees the humour of a
situation which to a less keen mind would only appear obscure and
topsy-turvy, and after a while he murmured softly to himself:</p>

<p>"They certainly are remarkable, these English!"</p>

<p>Memory had brought back to his mind that cruel, wolf-like look
which for one unguarded moment had distorted the features of the
spy. There was, then, some motive other than greed or love of
sport, that had pushed the Englishman into doing this dirty work.
Hatred? Love? Perhaps. Passion? Certainly.</p>

<p>"I wonder now!" mused M. de Kervoisin.</p>

<p>And being a Frenchman as well as a philosopher he was deeply
interested in this new problem.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 27</h2>

<p>But Rosemary was not gifted with second sight, and she saw
nothing of this while she knelt at the open window of her pretty
room at Kis-Imre. She was in such an agony of mind, that for a time
she became almost insentient. Presently, dressed as she was, she
threw herself upon the bed, because she was dog-tired and had no
longer the power to feel or to suffer. Even the well of her
sympathy appeared to be dry. She could not bring herself to think
of Elza or of Maurus, or to feel for them; even Philip and Anna
seemed blotted from her mind. An intense self-pity absorbed every
other sensation for the moment. She felt herself in such a hopeless
impasse that she had not even the strength to beat her hands
against the walls that had so completely closed her in.</p>

<p>And so she lay there for an hour and more while life in the
château went on, unheeded by her. Long afterwards she heard that,
as arranged, the guests all departed soon after nine o'clock, that
Elza had been there to see them off, looking after their comforts,
bidding them good-bye and tendering hospitable little invitations
for the future. Wonderful as always! Rosemary saw nothing of that.
She only heard of it afterwards, when she saw Elza again an hour or
two later. For the time being she was just a log—neither
thinking nor feeling; conscious only of that intense self-pity
which was so humiliating, because her senses were so numb that she
had not the power to trace that self-pity to its source. While she
lay on her bed, blind, deaf, dumb, she did not know that she
suffered; she did not know that she lived.</p>

<p>But this state of coma was the one concession to weakness. A
giving in. It was not the least like Rosemary; and as consciousness
slowly returned and with it the power to feel, she felt humiliated
on account of that weakness which was foreign to her. Fortunately
no one had witnessed it. Dear, wonderful Elza had had her hands
full, and the departing guests had only thought of being discreet
and tactful and of leaving this stricken home without putting too
great a strain upon the self-control of their hostess. They did not
know, of course, that tragedy had followed on the exciting events
of last night; but they asked no questions, well knowing that good
news spreads like wildfire, and guessing perhaps by Elza's set face
and expressionless eyes that something was not altogether
right.</p>

<p>Anyhow, they went away, and after their departure the house
became still—very still. Presently Rosemary had her bath and
dressed, then left the room to go and search for Elza. So far she
had not been able to gather anything from Rosa's stolid, round
face. The girl went about her work as if nothing special had
happened; only when Rosemary was ready to go downstairs and gave
Rosa a final nod, the girl suddenly said with an excited little
gasp: "The gracious count Philip and the Baroness Anna will be in
Hungary by now, won't they, gracious lady?"</p>

<p>Rosemary nodded. "We hope so," she murmured.</p>

<p>She waited in the hall for a little while, hoping that Elza
would presently be coming downstairs; but a quarter of an hour
later Anton came running down and made straight for the
telephone.</p>

<p>"What is it, Anton?" Rosemary asked.</p>

<p>"The gracious count," the man replied hurriedly. "He is ill. I
am telephoning to Cluj for the doctor."</p>

<p>"What is it, do you know?"</p>

<p>"No, gracious lady, the countess did not say, but I think it is
the heart. The gracious count has fainted, and—"</p>

<p>After that Anton was busy with the telephone, and Rosemary
wandered aimlessly into the drawing-room and out upon the
veranda.</p>

<p>Maurus ill! Yet another calamity striking that unfortunate
woman! Indeed, there was no room for self-pity in this house. Every
feeling of love, of sympathy and of pity must be concentrated on
Elza. She stood alone, just as Rosemary stood alone. Two women,
each with their burden. Elza with a load of boundless sorrow and
anxiety, and Rosemary with a terrible responsibility to face. Elza
was helpless; she could only watch and pray. But Rosemary had the
choice between waiting and acting. Sentiment on the one side;
Philip, Anna, Elza and Maurus, people she knew and loved; and duty
on the other, duty to others, to countless of unknown innocents, to
mothers, to father, to wives. "What are they to me?" cried
sentiment. "The few for the many," was the command of duty. Heart
and brain in direct conflict and no one to advise, no one to help,
save God, and He was silent! The affairs of men are so futile in
face of the Infinite.</p>

<p>Later on in the day the doctor came over in his motor from Cluj,
and after his visit Elza escorted him down into the hall. This was
the first glimpse that Rosemary had of her since the morning, and
the sight of her was a terrible shock; Elza was aged, her hair had
lost its lustre, her eyes their colour, her cheeks were the colour
of lead, and even her magnificent figure had shrunk. Elza looked an
old woman, wide-eyed and scared as if Fate was a tangible being
standing perpetually before her with flail upraised, striking,
striking incessantly, until the poor, weak shoulders bent under the
blows, and the last vestige of youth fled, chased away by pain.</p>

<p>As soon as the doctor had gone Elza came back to Rosemary.</p>

<p>"Poor Maurus," she said. "Have you heard?"</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" Rosemary asked.</p>

<p>Elza hesitated a moment, then she said:</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, it was a fit. He had had them before, and
you know he was always peculiar. And now the shock! The doctor says
we shall have to be very careful with him. He must be watched and
kept very quiet."</p>

<p>"Had you told him?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it is that which brought on the fit. The doctor asked me
if he had been more than usually agitated the last day or two."</p>

<p>"But he is in no danger?" Rosemary insisted.</p>

<p>"The doctor says not. But then he does not know. If—if the
worst happens with—Philip, I don't think that Maurus will
live it through."</p>

<p>Elza had allowed Rosemary to lead her into the drawing-room. She
sank down against the cushions and Rosemary knelt beside her, with
her arms round the poor woman's shoulders.</p>

<p>"Darling," she murmured, "is there anything I can do?"</p>

<p>"No, dear, nothing. What can you do? We are only atoms. So
helpless! We can only suffer. I suppose that God wants some of us
to suffer, and others to be happy. It seems strange and unjust, but
we cant help it. We must just get through with it." Elza spoke
jerkily, in a dry, cracked voice, without the slightest ring or
modulation in its dull monotony.</p>

<p>"Am I in the way, Elza darling?" Rosemary went on, trying with
loving eyes to probe the secret thoughts that lay hidden behind
that set, expressionless face. Elza turned large, round eyes upon
her, and for an instant a gleam of tenderness shot through
them.</p>

<p>"You are not in the way, darling," she said. "I don't know what
I should have done this morning if you had not been there to brace
me up. But it is miserable and dull for you here. Fancy you coming
all the way from England into this house of misery!"</p>

<p>"If you sent me away now," Rosemary said, "I should break my
heart with longing to be near you. But—I didn't know whether
you would not rather be alone—"</p>

<p>"Alone? I should indeed be alone if you went away. Now that the
children are not here...and Maurus must be kept very quiet—I
should be very lonely if you went."</p>

<p>Rosemary gave her hand a little squeeze.</p>

<p>"But Jasper will be coming soon," she said. "I am sure you won't
want him."</p>

<p>"Lord Tarkington is so kind," Elza replied gently, "and he would
be company for you. The doctor is sending me a couple of nursing
sisters from Cluj, but you know what Maurus is. He gets so
impatient if I am not there. So we shall not see much of one
another. But it would be a comfort to me to know that you are in
the house."</p>

<p>"You are an angel, Elza, and I am glad that you are not sending
me away. If you did I should not go very far. Probably to Cluj. I
could not exist far away from you whilst I had a glimmer of hope.
In my heart, darling," Rosemary went on earnestly, "I am still
convinced that God will not permit this monstrous injustice.
Something will happen. You will see. You will see."</p>

<p>"It would have to be a miracle, my dear," Elza said dully.</p>

<p>"God has accomplished greater miracles before this," Rosemary
retorted firmly.</p>

<p>Elza smiled. She, poor dear, obviously did not believe in
miracles.</p>

<p>After a moment or two she said:</p>

<p>"By the way, I quite forgot to tell you—so stupid of
me—this morning, while you were resting there came a
telephone message for you from Lord Tarkington."</p>

<p>"From Jasper?"</p>

<p>"He said he was coming some time in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"Where was he speaking from?"</p>

<p>"I am not quite sure, and, stupidly enough, I did not ask. When
I understood that it was Lord Tarkington speaking I asked if I
should send the carriage to meet him at Cluj. But all I heard in
reply was: 'No, no,' and then we were cut off. These telephone
people are so tiresome, they cut one off sometimes in the middle of
a conversation. I am so glad, darling," Elza continued gently,
"that Lord Tarkington is coming back. For your sake," she added,
"and also mine."</p>

<p>After that she rose and gave Rosemary a final kiss.</p>

<p>"I have one or two little things to see to before lunch," she
said, "but I understood from Lord Tarkington that he would not be
over before the afternoon."</p>

<p>And she went off with her bunch of keys jingling in her hand,
outwardly quite serene, and presently Rosemary could hear her
calling to the servants, giving orders, scolding for something left
undone. She was still wonderful, even though the elasticity had
gone out of her step; and her back was bent like an old woman's,
her voice had lost its metallic ring, and all the glorious colour
had gone out of her hair.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 28</h2>

<p>Jasper arrived in the late afternoon, unheeded and unannounced.
Elza and Rosemary were in the garden at the time, and he was in the
house for over a quarter of an hour before they heard that he had
come. Then she and Elza hurried to greet him. He was in the
drawing-room waiting patiently. Rosemary thought him looking tired
or perhaps travel-stained.</p>

<p>He kissed Elza's hand first, then his wife's, no more. But
Rosemary knew her Jasper. He could not have kissed her in front of
anyone, and Elza for once did not seem surprised at the cold,
formal greeting between husband and wife. She asked a few
questions: "Will you have something to eat, dear Lord Tarkington?"
and "How did you come?"</p>

<p>Jasper gave the required explanations.</p>

<p>He had jumped out of the train at Apahida, which is the next
station before Cluj, to get a drink, and whom should he see in the
station restaurant but General Naniescu, who had driven out in his
motor on some business or other. Hearing that Jasper was on his way
to Kis-Imre, he offered to drive him over. It was a kind offer, as
Jasper was sick of the train journey. He had only hand-luggage with
him, and this he transferred, together with himself, to Naniescu's
motor. And here he was—very glad to be back.</p>

<p>Elza asked him what had become of the luggage, and where the
motor was.</p>

<p>Jasper explained that he had put the motor and the chauffeur up
at the inn. General Naniescu had only driven in as far as Cluj, and
after that had graciously put the motor and chauffeur at his,
Tarkington's disposal, not only for the day but for as long as he
and Rosemary would care to use it. The chauffeur was bringing the
luggage over presently and would give it to Anton.</p>

<p>"The car might be very useful," Jasper went on, turning to his
wife, "so I accepted the offer gladly. I thought it kind of old
Naniescu."</p>

<p>Of course, he knew nothing of what had occurred, but even so his
mention of Naniescu's name hurt Rosemary. She had already read
failure in her husband's eyes—complete failure, and all of a sudden
she realized how much hope she had built on this mission of
Jasper's, and how it had dwelt at the back of her mind whenever she
tried to comfort Elza. Now there was nothing left to hope for,
nothing to believe in. Even faith appeared shipwrecked in this new
tidal-wave of despair.</p>

<p>Rosemary had always found it difficult to extricate herself from
Jasper's arms once he held her tight, and this he did a few moments
later, when, at Elza's suggestion that Rosemary should see him up
to his room, he found himself alone with her. He took her breath
away with the suddenness, the almost save strength of his
embrace.</p>

<p>"Jasper!" she murmured once or twice. "Jasper! Please!"</p>

<p>"I was so hungry for you, my Rosemary," he said. "Ten days—my
God, ten days without your kiss!"</p>

<p>He looked her straight between the eyes and whispered
huskily:</p>

<p>"I've been in hell, little one."</p>

<p>Rosemary tried to smile: "But why, my dear? We can't expect to
be always, always together, every day for the rest of our natural
lives."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you expect from life, little one, but I do
know that if you send me away from you again, I should not come out
of that hell again alive."</p>

<p>"But I did not send you away, Jasper," she argued, a little
impatient with him because of his wild talk. "Your going to
Bucharest was entirely your own idea."</p>

<p>"And I have lamentably failed," he muttered with a shrug.</p>

<p>She gave a little gasp that sounded like a sob.</p>

<p>"There was nothing to be done?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"The King?"</p>

<p>"Indifferent. He trusts Naniescu, has confidence in his
judgement, and believes in his patriotism and sense of
justice."</p>

<p>"Then there is absolutely nothing to be done," she reiterated
slowly in a dull dream-voice.</p>

<p>She was keying herself up to tell him all that had happened in
the past four-and-twenty hours. But she was so tired, almost on the
verge of breaking down. She did not think that she would have the
strength to go through with the long tale of hope and despair. But
Jasper made her sit down on the sofa and arranged a couple of
cushions round her head. Then he sat down on a low chair beside
her.</p>

<p>"Now tell me, little one," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"Why, Jasper," she exclaimed, "how did you guess that there was
anything to tell?"</p>

<p>"Don't I know every line of your adorable face," he retorted,
"every flicker almost of your eyelid? Before I touched your hand I
knew that something was amiss. After that I was sure."</p>

<p>"Dear," she murmured, and nestled her hand in his. Wasn't Jasper
wonderful too? With his marvellous understanding and that utterly
selfless love for her, who, alas! gave so little in return. He bent
his head and pressed his lips upon her wrist.</p>

<p>"You guessed right," she said. "Something is very much
amiss."</p>

<p>Then she told him everything. He listened to the whole tale
without a comment, and even after she had finished speaking he sat
in silence with her hand held between his own, only bending his
head now and again in order to kiss her wrist.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to be done!" she reiterated, with a pitiable
little catch in her voice.</p>

<p>And after awhile he said quite quietly and deliberately:</p>

<p>"The only thing to be done, my dear, is to comply with
Naniescu's wish."</p>

<p>But against this she at once exclaimed, hot with indignation,
and he went on with a sigh: "I know, I know. You are such a sweet,
enthusiastic creature, and you have embraced the cause of these
good people whole-heartedly, injudiciously. I don't want to
influence you, of course—"</p>

<p>"You promised me that you would not," she retorted.</p>

<p>"I know! I know! You would not be the adorable creature that you
are if you were not unreasonable sometimes. But—I put it to
you—what harm would you do in writing the articles that Naniescu
wants?"</p>

<p>This question roused Rosemary's indignation once more.</p>

<p>"How can you ask?" she queried. "To begin with I should alienate
from these wretched people over here all the sympathy which Philip
Imrey's articles have aroused for them abroad. Never again after
that could any friend raise a voice on their behalf. Naniescu or
his kind would have a free hand. He knows that well enough. Not
only he, but all the waverers, all the selfish and the indifferent
could in the future point to The Times and say: 'Hardship!
Nonsense! Why, here was an independent lady journalist—and a woman
at that—with every opportunity for getting at the truth, and she
writes at full length to tell the entire world that the
administration in Transylvania is a model of equity and
benevolence.' And mothers like Elza would cry in vain because their
sons had been torn from them, families would be sent into exile,
fathers, brothers murdered, oppression, confiscation, outrage would
go unpunished, all because one woman had been too great a coward to
smother sentiment under the mantle of justice."</p>

<p>Jasper had not uttered a word, hardly made a sign, while
Rosemary spoke her impassioned tirade. Only from time to time his
dark eyes flashed with a glance of admiration on his beautiful
wife, who, with flaming cheeks and slightly dishevelled hair,
looked perhaps more desirable in her indignation than she had ever
done in repose.</p>

<p>When she paused for want of breath he slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>"And do you really think, my darling," he said softly, "that you
can permanently influence English and American opinion by a few
newspaper articles, even if these are written by a well-known
person like yourself? Dear heart, in order to do that you would
have to go at your subject hammer and tongs, never allow one
article to be forgotten before you write another; you must be at
your subject all the time if you want to create an
impression—hammer away at the newspaper—reading public until its
stupid wooden head is saturated with the stuff you give it.
Naniescu thinks a great deal of these articles which he wants you
to write. Well, in my opinion their effect would last just one week
after the last of them has appeared. After that some philanthropist
or other will have his say on the maladministration of
Transylvania, and you are not bound to refute that again, are you?
But in the meanwhile Philip and Anna will be comfortably out of the
country, and even Elza and Maurus will have settled down somewhere
in Hungary to await better times; you will have saved the lives of
two young things whom you love, and spared these good people here a
terrible sorrow."</p>

<p>While Jasper spoke Rosemary could not do anything but stare at
him. His sophistry amazed her. That there was a modicum of common
sense in his argument was not to be gainsaid, but that the
suggestion of such bargaining with truth and honour should come
from Jasper, her husband, horrified Rosemary and revolted her. And
men often accused women of a feeble sense of honour! From the first
Rosemary had turned away from Naniescu's proposal as from something
unclean. She had never dwelt on it, not for a moment. Even this
morning, when first she felt herself sinking into an abyss of
despair, she had not dwelt on that. But Jasper had not only dwelt
on it; he had weighed its possibilities, the "for" and "against"
which, with unanswerable logic and not a little sarcasm, he had
just put before her. And even now, when she could not keep the look
of horror out of her eyes, he only smiled, quite kindly and
indulgently, as if she were just an obstinate child who had to be
coaxed into reason; and when indignation kept her dumb he patted
her hand and said gently:</p>

<p>"You will think over it, I am sure!" Then he rose and started
pacing up and down the room, as was his custom when he was
irritated or worried, with his head thrust forward and his hands
clasped behind his back.</p>

<p>"You will think over it," he murmured again.</p>

<p>"Never!" she retorted hotly.</p>

<p>"You have another fifteen days before you."</p>

<p>"Never!" she reiterated firmly.</p>

<p>He looked at her for a moment or two with an indefinable smile
on his lean, dark face, then he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"How much longer can you stand the mother's tears," he asked,
"and the father's despair?"</p>

<p>"Elza, if she knew," Rosemary rejoined, with an obstinate toss
of her head, "would be the first to wish me to stand firm."</p>

<p>"Try her!" Jasper retorted laconically. Then as Rosemary,
reproachful, indignant, made no attempt to reply, he went on with
harsh insistence: "Have you tried her? Does she know that the life
of her son is entirely and absolutely in your hands?"</p>

<p>Rosemary shook her head.</p>

<p>"No!" she murmured.</p>

<p>Jasper gave a harsh laugh. "Then," he said, "I can only repeat
what I said just now. Go and tell Elza everything, the see if her
arguments will be different form mine!"</p>

<p>"Jasper!" Rosemary exclaimed, flushed with bitterness and
resentment.</p>

<p>He paused in his restless walk, looked at her for a moment or
two, and then resumed his seat beside her. For an instant it seemed
as if he wanted to take her hand, or put his arms round her, but
whether she divined this wish or no, certain it is that she made a
slight movement, a drawing back away from him. A curious flash,
like a veritable volcano of hidden fires, shot through the man's
deep, dark eyes, and, as if to control his own movements, he
clasped his hands tightly together between his knees. Strangely
enough, when he next spoke his voice was full of tenderness and
almost of humility.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, dear," he said gently, "if I hurt you. God knows
that I would rather be broken to pieces on a rack than do that. But
things have come to a pass," he went on more harshly, "where my
duty—and my right—as your natural friend and protector command me
to get you out of this impasse before all this damnable business
has affected your health, or, God help us! clouded your brain."</p>

<p>"The impasse, as you very justly call it, Jasper," she riposted,
"will not cloud my brain, so long as you do not seek to make right
seem wrong and wrong right."</p>

<p>Then suddenly he dropped on one knee close beside her; before
she could prevent him his two hands had closed upon hers, and he
looked up into her face with a glance full of love and entreaty,
whilst every tone of harshness went out of his voice.</p>

<p>"But child, child," he urged, "don't you see, can't you
understand, that it is you who make right seem wrong? What good
will you do, by letting those two wretched young idiots suffer the
extreme penalty for their folly? Will you ever afterwards know one
moment's peace? Won't you for ever be haunted by the ghosts of
those whom you could so easily have saved? Won't your ears ring for
ever with the whole-hearted curses of these wretched people, who
will look upon you as the murderer of their son? And, honestly, my
dear, your articles in The Times won't do more than flatter the
vanity of Naniescu. Those people in England and America who have
really studied the question won't think any the better of Roumanian
rule or misrule in Transylvania because a lady journalist—eminent,
I grant you—chooses to tell them that everything is for the best in
the best possible occupied world. Think of all those articles in
The Times on the subject of the French occupation in the Ruhr and
their misrule in the Palatinate—did it prevent the very readers of
that same paper from joining the League of the Friends of France
and proclaiming at the top of their voices their belief in the
unselfish aims of M. Poincaré? You attach too much importance to
the Press, my dearest. Roumania and Transylvania are very, very far
away from Clapham and Ealing. People don't trouble their heads much
what goes on there. A few do, but they are the ones who will stick
to their opinions whatever you may say."</p>

<p>Unable to free them, Rosemary had yielded her hands passively to
Jasper's clasp. She lay back with her head resting upon the
cushions, her eyes obstinately evading his glance and fixed upon
the ceiling, as if vainly seeking up there for some hidden writing
that in a few terse words would tell her what to do. Jasper thus
holding her captive by her hands made her feel like an imprisoned
soul bruising itself against the bars of an unseen cage. She felt
fettered, compelled, unable to see, to visualize that rigid code of
honour which had ruled her actions until now. Jasper had talked at
great length; she had never heard him talk so long and so earnestly
and with such unanswerable logic. And Rosemary, who up to this hour
had seen her line of action before her, crystal-clear, was suddenly
assailed with doubts, more torturing than any mental agony which
she had suffered before. Doubt—awful, hideous, torturing doubt. How
could she fight that sinister monster "compromise" if the one man
whom she could trust tilted on its side? She had never dreamed of
such a possibility. And now, suddenly, Jasper had made such a thing
possible—worse, imperative!</p>

<p>Rosemary felt her eyes filling with tears. She was so tired and
could not argue. She dreaded argument lest she should give in. It
was all so utterly, utterly hopeless. Jasper was out of sympathy
with her, and Peter—Peter—</p>

<p>She must unconsciously have murmured the name, for all of a
sudden Jasper jumped to his feet with a loud curse.</p>

<p>"If you mention that devils' name—" he began. Then once
more he started on his restless pacing, with lips firmly set almost
as if he were afraid that words would come tumbling out of them
against his will.</p>

<p>"Jasper!" Rosemary exclaimed, "why do you hate Peter so?"</p>

<p>"Hate him?" Jasper retorted harshly. "Does one hate a snake—or a
worm?"</p>

<p>"That is unjust," she riposted, "and untrue. You forced a
promise from me not to confide in Peter. But I wish to God I had
spoken to him, asked for his help. Peter half belongs to these
people; he would have helped us if he had known."</p>

<p>But Jasper only threw his head back and broke into a harsh,
sardonic laugh:</p>

<p>"Peter?" he exclaimed. "Peter Blakeney help you? Heavens above!
Don't you know, child," he went on, and once more came and sat down
beside her, "that Peter Blakeney is nothing but a paid spy of the
Roumanian Government? I warned you; I told you. You remember that
day, when you did not even know that he was in Transylvania, he was
in Cluj in touch with Naniescu. I warned you then as much as I
dared. I could not say much because—because—" He paused,
perhaps because he had felt Rosemary's eyes fixed upon him with a
curious, challenging look. A second or two later he went on coldly:
"And the denunciation of Anna and Philip? How did it come about?
Who knew of their folly except you and Peter Blakeney? And what
about last night? I warned you not to confide in Peter, not to
speak with him of the whole thing while I was away. Are you quite
sure, quite, quite sure that Peter knew nothing of the plan? Are
you quite sure that he—"</p>

<p>"Jasper! Stop!" Rosemary cried; and with a great effort she
pushed Jasper away from her and rose to her feet. She wanted above
all to get away from him. She would not listen. She would not hear,
because—because every word that Jasper spoke was a dart that hit
straight at her heart, and every dart was marked with the word
"Truth." All that Jasper said she had heard whispered about her by
unseen demons who had tortured her for days with these horrible
suspicions. She had rejected them, fought against them with all her
might; but no sooner had she silenced one tempter than another took
his place and whispered, whispered awful words that, strung
together, became a fearful, and irrefutable indictment against
Peter. But this, she would not admit; not now, not before anyone,
not even before Jasper.</p>

<p>"I won't believe it," she said firmly. "I have known Peter all
my life, and what you suggest is monstrous. There have been strange
coincidences, I admit, but—"</p>

<p>"Strange," Jasper broke in with a sneer. "You are right there,
little one. It is a strange coincidence, shall we say, that has
made Peter Blakeney the new owner of this house."</p>

<p>"Whatever to do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That Peter Blakeney has bought an option on the château and
property of Kis-Imre from the Roumanian Government."</p>

<p>Rosemary frowned in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Jasper," she said, "will you please tell me clearly what you do
mean?"</p>

<p>"I have told you, dear heart, as clearly as I could. But perhaps
you have not realized that if Philip and Anna are brought before a
military tribunal and convicted of treason against the State, these
estates, together with the château, will be confiscated. It will
then be sold for the benefit of the State and the owners will be
expelled from the country."</p>

<p>Rosemary felt herself shuddering. "No," she said slowly; "I had
not realized that."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that it is so. And in the meanwhile, some who are
in the know have already cast covetous eyes on this admirable
château and beautiful park and garden, and our friend Naniescu has
hit on the happy idea of selling the option of them to the highest
bidder. And it seems that Peter Blakeney was the lucky man. He has
paid a few hundred thousand leis for a first option on Kis-Imre and
its dependencies, should it come in the market after the conviction
and presumably the death of his cousins for treason against the
State."</p>

<p>"Who told you all that?" Rosemary queried coldly.</p>

<p>"Our friend Naniescu."</p>

<p>"And you believed it?"</p>

<p>"I could not help believing; Naniescu showed me the contract for
the option. It was signed 'Peter Blakeney'."</p>

<p>"If Peter has done that," Rosemary went on slowly, "it is
because he wants to secure the place ultimately for Elza."</p>

<p>Jasper smiled tenderly. "You are a loyal friend, sweetheart," he
said.</p>

<p>"The accusation is so monstrous," Rosemary retorted, "it defeats
its own ends."</p>

<p>"I wish I could think so," he rejoined with a sigh.
"Unfortunately, ever since Peter's arrival in Cluj I have seen
nothing but one calamity after another fall upon these wretched
people here. I only wish I had your belief in coincidences. I only
wish I could explain satisfactorily to myself how those two
children, how Elza, Maurus, all of us, have come to this terrible
pass, at the end of which there is nothing but chaos. But there,"
he went on with his usual gentleness and patience, "I won't worry
you any longer. I have said my say. I have put my case before you.
Perhaps I look at it too much from a selfish point of view. I am
heart-broken to see you so wretched, and feel like hitting out
right and left to set you free from this awful impasse. So now,
sweetheart, try and forgive me, and think over it all from my point
of view a little. The people here are nothing to me, you are
everything. All the world and more. Even Heaven would be nothing to
me without you, and this place is a hell when you are not
here."</p>

<p>Rosemary was standing close by the open window. The sky was
grey. Great banks of cloud rose and tumbled about the mountain
tops. The pine trees on the hill-side appeared like ghostly
sentinels standing at attention in the mist. The heat was
oppressive. From far away came the dull rumble of distant thunder.
The tuberoses beneath the window sent a heady, intoxicating scent
through the storm-laden air. Rosemary felt terribly wearied, and
for the first time in her life discouraged. She had striven for
right, smothered every sentiment for the sake of abstract justice,
and in the end right was proclaimed to be wrong, at best a fantasy
born of her own vanity. Was Jasper right, after all? He had rather
a way of being always right. Anyway, he was English and practical;
sentiment had no part in his organization. Even his love, deep as
it was, was not sentiment. Rosemary had found this out before now.
It was not sentiment—it was elemental passion. But his views of
life were built neither on sentiment nor passion. He looked at
things straight, as Englishmen of a certain type do, who despise
sentiment and whose unanswerable argument is: "Well, it is the
right thing to do."</p>

<p>But, heavens above! what was the right thing now? Rosemary felt
sick and faint; the heat and the scent of the tuberoses made her
head ache and her eyes smart. Jasper was saying something, but she
hardly heard him, and she hardly felt his nearness when he took her
hand and pressed it against his lips.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 29</h2>

<p>But a moment or two later a curious thing happened.</p>

<p>Jasper had gone out of the room, and Rosemary, leaning against
the window frame, was looking out into the approaching storm. She
had not heard what Jasper had said just before he kissed her hand;
but her mind must have registered it, must have made a kind of
record of it, like that of a gramophone, because now some of his
words came back to her quite distinctly through the rumblings of
distant thunder. She had not heard him then, but she heard him now
quite distinctly—every word.</p>

<p>"I have jotted down a few ideas. You, of course, will put them
into your own picturesque language. Just a few notes of what
Naniescu would like to see in The Times. I thought it would save
you the trouble to think. I don't think that you will find anything
glaringly impossible in my suggestions."</p>

<p>Then he had put something down on the table. Memory had
registered a kind of swishing sound. And Rosemary, now turning
slowly away from the window, caught sight of that something on the
table. Half a dozen loose sheets of paper covered with Jasper's
clear, minute handwriting. Like a sleep-walker Rosemary went to the
table and picked up the sheets. The shades of evening were drawing
in, and the heavy grey clouds in the sky blotted out the remaining
rags of daylight. With the papers in her hand Rosemary went out on
the balcony. She had the feeling that while she read she must have
the pure, storm-laden air about her. She had not turned away from
these notes of Jasper's in horror. She had not closed her ears to
the record of his words. She knew quite well what was written on
these sheets of paper, and deliberately she sat down and began to
read.</p>

<p>The political and economic situation of Transylvania was stated
in these brief notes with remarkable lucidity. Jasper's clear,
unemotional outlook on the administration of the conquered country
was set forth without any imagery or attempt at style. Even the
obvious bias in favour of the ruling Government was tempered by
sound logic and a certain measure of indulgent toleration for the
other side. Rosemary read the notes through twice very carefully.
She could hear Jasper's voice in every sentence, feel his presence
while she read. Long after she had finished reading she sat there
quite still, with the sheets of paper lying on her lap and her
hands folded over them. She marvelled whether she was quite sane.
Jasper had said at one moment that this terrible impasse might
overcloud her brain. Well, perhaps it had done that already, and
she could no longer distinguish right from wrong through the
clouds.</p>

<p>Evening closed in about her. The garden down below became a
blur, through which white, starry flowers blinked up at her, and
with their placidity mocked the turmoil which was rending her soul.
The thunder-clouds were drawing nearer; they hung like lead over
the mountains. The pine trees, like dark sentinels, shivered at
times under a sudden gust of wind, and from time to time a pale
reflex of distant lightning lit the sky above the valley.</p>

<p>Rosa came presently into the room and turned on the lights; she
inquired anxiously whether the gracious lady would not come in, as
it was raining already and the storm would be breaking very soon.
Then only did Rosemary become conscious that her hair and her dress
were wet. Heavy drops, the size of a shilling, were falling, but
she had not noticed them before.</p>

<p>She came in and quite mechanically she locked the papers up in
her dressing-case. She asked Rosa what the time was, and whether
dinner would be at the usual time. Yes, dinner would be at eight
o'clock as usual, and it was now past seven. Rosa asked if the
gracious lady would like to change her dress.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening was like a dream. Elza presided at
dinner and she and Jasper did most of the talking—that is to
say, Elza asked innumerable questions to which Jasper gave long
replies, with forced cheerfulness. Maurus, it seemed, was better.
The doctor was coming again the last thing at night, but the
patient was much calmer, had taken some nourishment in the way of
milk, and had slept for an hour. Elza, self-possessed, wonderful as
usual, lingered over dessert. She poured out coffee, offered
liqueur and cigarettes. For her hospitality and its duties were a
religion; she would as soon have neglected them as a devout
Catholic would neglect confession. The very fact that they cost her
an effort made them all the more imperative and in a way
comforting.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock Rosemary found herself once more alone in her
room. Jasper had kissed her tenderly when he bade her goodnight.
Only when she did find herself alone did Rosemary realize how much
she had dreaded this goodnight. She knew that she had no reserve of
strength left to stand one of Jasper's savage outbursts of passion;
to-night of all nights she would have gone down under it like the
tuberoses below her window under the lashing of the storm.</p>

<p>The rain beat against the window-panes, terrific crashes of
thunder followed one another in close succession, and every few
minutes the sky seemed rent right through with blinding flashes of
lightning. The heat was nearly intolerable through this almost
tropical storm. Rosemary had dismissed Rosa. She undid her hair,
which clung damp against her forehead and the back of her neck, and
clad only in chemise and petticoat, with bare arms and neck, and
bare feet thrust into slippers, she sat down at the table with
Jasper's notes before her, and read them through once more.</p>

<p>After that she searched through the chest of drawers for a
bundle of manuscript paper, and taking up her fountain-pen she
began to write. She had Jasper's notes in front of her, and she put
them, as he had suggested, into her well-known, picturesque
language. She enlarged upon them, amplified them, always keeping
his suggestions as a background for her own statements.</p>

<p>For hours she sat there writing. It was the longest spell of
uninterrupted work that she had ever accomplished, but she was not
even conscious of fatigue. The storm raged for a while longer, but
she did not hear it. Only the heat worried her, and from time to
time she mopped her forehead and the back of her neck with her
handkerchief.</p>

<p>The storm passed by, and the air became very still as slowly the
dawn chased away the night. The waning moon peeped through the
clouds, only to melt away in the translucent ether; one by one the
birds awoke, shook their wet feathers and called to their mates.
But not until she had written the last line did Rosemary rise from
the table. Then she put her papers together, put a clip through
them, arranged Jasper's notes separately, and locked up both sets
in her dressing-case.</p>

<p>After that she put on a wrap and threw open the window. The
clock in her room struck five. She had been writing for six hours!
The task was done. There it stood ready, and Elza should decide. In
this Jasper had been quite right—wasn't he always right? It was for
Elza to decide. Her son's life on the one hand, her people's
welfare on the other. It was for her to decide. Philip was her son;
the oppressed people of Transylvania her kindred. Jasper was quite
right. Let Elza decide.</p>

<p>And after Rosemary had saturated her lungs with the pure air of
the morning, she went to bed and slept soundly, heavily, until Rosa
came into her room later on with her breakfast.</p>

<p>And when, presently, Jasper came in, Rosemary was able to greet
him with a smile which was not altogether forced. She was able to
return his kiss, and after awhile to tell him what she had
done.</p>

<p>"The articles are written," she said, "and ready for
publication. I have even written a covering letter and addressed
the envelope to the editor of The Times, asking him kindly to
arrange for their publication at the earliest possible date. But
before I put the articles in the post, I shall give them to Elza to
read. She shall decide if they are to go. You were quite right,
dear," she added, and looked Jasper quite frankly, unwaveringly, in
the eyes. "It is a matter for Elza to decide."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 30</h2>

<p>Rosemary found herself alone with Elza in the early part of the
afternoon. The doctor had been over in the morning to see Maurus,
and on the whole the bulletin was satisfactory: "The patient was
doing well. If he was kept very quiet there would be no
complications. He was no age, and on the whole had led an
abstemious life. The most important thing was to keep all worry,
all agitation from him, both now and in the future."</p>

<p>Both now and in the future! Elza dwelt on those words when she
told Rosemary just what the doctor had said.</p>

<p>"The future!" she murmured with a weary little sigh. "Of course,
the doctor does not know. Perhaps I ought to tell him what the
future holds in store for poor Maurus."</p>

<p>The nursing sisters had arrived overnight. Rosemary had caught
sight of them about the house during the course of the morning,
with their white-winged caps that made them look like doves with
outspread wings. Their felt shoes made not the slightest noise as
they walked. They were very sweet and very restful, entirely
incompetent but exceedingly kind, and full of gentle pity and kind
advice to the patient, who became terribly irritable as soon as
they ministered to him.</p>

<p>After lunch Rosemary persuaded Elza to come out with her into
the garden. It was the first bright moment in the day. Neither
morning nor early afternoon had kept the promise made by the dawn.
Storm clouds hung, heavy and leaden, over the mountains, and dull
rumblings proclaimed the return of thunder. But about three o'clock
there was a break in the clouds, and a pale sun shot fitful gleams
of silvery light upon park and garden. It was oppressively hot.
Rosemary led Elza to the summer-house and made her sit down. Elza
was fidgety. It almost seemed as if she did not want to be left
alone with Rosemary. She made one excuse after another: Maurus! the
chef! the stables! But Rosemary insisted.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Elza, darling," she said firmly. "I want your
full attention for two minutes."</p>

<p>Elza turned her big blue eyes upon Rosemary and murmured like an
obedient child: "Yes, dear! What is it?"</p>

<p>Rosemary had the papers in her hand: the newspaper articles
which she had written during the night. The hand that held the
manuscript shook ever so slightly, but her voice was quite
steady.</p>

<p>"I want you," she said to Elza, "to read very carefully what I
have written here. They are newspaper articles which General
Naniescu would like to see published in England and in America.
When you have read them you will understand why. He wants this so
badly that on the day these articles are published Philip and Anna
will receive a full pardon, Kis-Imre will not be taken from you,
and, if you wish, you can all leave the country for a time until
things settle down and better times come for you all."</p>

<p>She thrust the papers into Elza's hands and turned to go.</p>

<p>"I will leave you to read quite quietly," she said.</p>

<p>But Elza's round blue eyes were still staring at her.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you, dear," she murmured vaguely.</p>

<p>"Of course you don't, darling," Rosemary rejoined gently; "but
you will when you have read what I have written. The gipsy was
quite right; it is in my power to save Philip and Anna, but only to
a certain extent, because it is you alone who can decide if I am to
exercise that power or not. God bless you, darling!"</p>

<p>She put her arms round Elza and kissed her tenderly. Thank
Heaven all self-pity, all selfish introspection had gone from her.
Her thoughts, her love, her pity were all for Elza. But it had to
be. Elza must decide. Her people! Her son! She must decide!</p>

<p>When Rosemary hastened across the lawn she turned once more
toward the summer-house. Elza was still sitting there, staring with
big blue eyes into vacancy. Every line of her attitude indicated
bewilderment. She had the packet of paper in her hand and was
tapping it against her knee. Poor Elza! A heavy sob rose from
Rosemary's aching heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 31</h2>

<p>Rosemary did not Elza against that day. Just before dinner Rosa
came with a short scribbled note from her. "Maurus is very
restless," it said; "I don't like to leave him. Will you and dear
Lord Tarkington forgive me if I don't join you at dinner?"</p>

<p>The evening was dreary. Jasper said very little, and Rosemary
felt thoroughly out of tune with him; he had a meek air about him
that irritated her. Hers was not a nature to sympathize with
remorse, and Jasper's manner gave the idea that he regretted having
forced her into a decision. So she gave curt answers when he spoke
to her, and after dinner he retired into the smoking-room with the
excuse that he had some business letters to write. She sat reading
most of the evening, her nerves on edge, hearing all sorts of
mysterious sounds through the apparent stillness of the house.</p>

<p>When Jasper came to say good night she felt sorry for him. He
looked forlorn and miserable, and reason told Rosemary that he of
all people ought not to be allowed to suffer through a situation
that was none of his making. Poor Jasper! She, his wife, had
dragged him, unwillingly enough, into this impasse wherein his
quiet habits of a wealthy English gentleman were hopelessly
perturbed and his outlook outraged at every point. So, after she
had returned his last kiss and saw him going upstairs, slowly,
dragging one step after another, almost like an old man, she ran
after him and linked her arm in his, and gave him an tender and
sympathetic smile. The look of gratitude which he gave her in
return warmed her heart. Here, at least, was no divided duty. In a
moment of pique—it was nothing less than that—she had
linked her fate with Jasper Tarkington, accepted from him all the
lavish gifts that wealth could buy, and which he so generously
bestowed upon her. In exchange for that he only asked for her love;
and if the love which he gave and demanded did not reach that
sublime ideal of which Rosemary had once dreamed, at any rate it
was loyal and ungrudging and she had no right to let her caprice
stand in the way of his happiness.</p>

<p>It was perhaps strange that these thoughts should come to her at
a moment when her whole soul was torn with a terrible sorrow and a
racking anxiety; perhaps they came because on this very day she had
made the greatest abdication of her will that she had ever done in
all her life. She had always acted for herself, judged for herself,
set herself a high standard of straight living and straight
thinking, and lived up to it. To-day she had left a decision which
should have been hers in the hands of another. She knew that she
had done right, but her pride was humiliated, and to soothe that
pride she set herself a fresh standard of duty to Jasper and
determined to live up to that.</p>

<p>But ever afterwards she turned away with a shudder from thoughts
of this evening, when she probed the full depth of Jasper's passion
for her, and saw before her like a row of spectres the vision of an
endless vista of years, during which every caress would mean for
her an effort, and every kiss a lie.</p>

<p>The new standard of duty which she had set herself would be very
difficult to live up to. She had never loved Jasper, only hoped
that she might learn to love him one day, but on this fateful
evening she realized that she might in time learn to hate him.</p>

<p>When at last she was alone she found herself unable to rest.
Through the open window the sounds of the oncoming storm became
more and more insistent. It was rolling in on the bosom of the
clouds from over the mountains in the west. Already one or two
vivid flashes of lighting had rent the sky, and now and then great
gusts of wind swept across the valley and sent a soughing and
whispering through the trees. The poplars bowed their crests, and
the twisted branches of the old acacias shivered and cracked in the
blast. It was insufferably hot, and there was a smell of sulphur in
the air. Rosemary in a thin lace wrap could not succeed in keeping
cool. She stood by the open window, longing for the storm to break
in all its fury, so that she might be rid of this feeling of
oppression which was so unendurable, because the storm, far or
near, had gone on almost uninterruptedly for over twenty-four
hours. Rosemary's thoughts now were with Elza. She pictured to
herself the unfortunate woman wrestling with a decision which
either way must mean the breaking of her heart. Elza, who outwardly
seemed just a soft, futile, pampered doll, with thoughts fixed on
her menus and her servants, was a veritable heroine, strong and
tenacious, proud without vanity, loving without weakness, the type
that represented everything that was finest and best in a woman.
She was of the stuff that religious martyrs were made of in the
past, and she would not come to a decision without a terrible
struggle. If in the end her heart overruled the dictates of justice
and of right, her remorse would be as devastating as her courage
hitherto had been sublime.</p>

<p>If Elza had been a religious woman she would not have suffered
nearly so cruelly. The pagan knows nothing of the comfort of
prayer, of diving blindly from the rocks of care into the ocean of
God's love. And Elza was only a pagan from whom the thin veneer of
Christianity laid on in early life had been rubbed off long ago.
She would not now be on her knees, murmuring with heaven-born
resignation: "Lord, not my will, but thine be done!" she would be
fighting a tough battle, wrestling with her heart, castigating her
tenderest feelings, fighting alone, unaided, unconsoled.</p>

<p>Poor, poor Elza! Rosemary, looking out into the storm, seemed to
see the pretty round face distorted by grief, the big, child-like
eyes gazing bewildered on the immensity of the puzzle which the
Fates had set for her to solve. And while Rosemary gazed the storm
became full of pictures, each lightning flash revealed a face.
Elza! Philip, dark-eyed, enthusiastic, the idealist! Anna, gentle
and resigned. Maurus, the man, the head of the family, the trunk of
the tree weaker than its branches. And then Peter. Oh, Peter filled
the night with his presence. There was Peter in flannels, a boy
with bright eyes and curly head, fighting life's battles with a
cricket bat and a joke. Peter home on leave from that hell in
Belgium, receiving from his king the supreme reward for an act of
almost unequalled bravery, of which, in his boyish way, he would
often look quite ashamed. And Peter that night in June, long ago.
Peter's strong arms round her shoulders. Peter's impassioned words,
vying in melody with the nightingale. Peter's kiss that opened wide
the portals of Heaven; and, lastly, Peter the mysterious, the
subtle, unseen influence in whose wake strode sorrow and disaster.
And the rumbling of the thunder brought back to Rosemary's ears
Jasper's words of warning: "I only wish I had your belief in
coincidences;" and "Ever since Peter's arrival I have seen nothing
but one calamity after another fall upon these wretched people
here." And then that awful, awful indictment which she had been
unable to refute: "Don't you know that Peter Blakeney is a paid spy
of the Roumanian Government?" The thunder brought the echo of those
terrible words. Louder and louder, for the storm was drawing
nearer, and the echo of those awful words drowned the very sound of
thunder.</p>

<p>All at once the storm broke in all its fury; there was a
deafening crash and a flash of lightning so vivid that for the
space of one second the garden stood revealed as if in broad
daylight before Rosemary's gaze, clear-cut in every detail, every
tree, every leaf, every flower, every ripple upon the lake, each
pebble upon the garden walk; and in that one second Rosemary had
seen Peter standing on the gravel walk, not fifty yards from her
window, and looking up at her—gazing. She caught his eyes in
that one flash. He was dressed in a dark suit, his cricketing cap
was on his head. It had been an instant's flash, but she had seen
him, and he was gazing up her window. And their eyes had met in
that one flash, right through the storm.</p>

<p>After that all was darkness, and though from time to time the
night was rent by lightning flashes, Rosemary did not see Peter
again. And when later on the storm subsided, and, wearied out, she
went to bed and slept, she dreamt that all her suspicions of Peter
had been proved to be wrong. She dreamt that she was a few years
younger, that they were on the river together, in a punt, and that
the nightingale was singing. She dreamt of the lapping of the water
against the low-lying river bank, of the scent of meadow-sweet, and
of the honey-coloured moon that painted long lines of golden light
upon the reeds. She dreamt that Peter kissed her, and that she was
free to give him kiss for kiss.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 32</h2>

<p>When Rosemary woke the next morning she felt quite convinced
that the vision which she had had in the night, of Peter standing
on the gravel walk and looking up at her window, was only a
creation of her own fancy. Rosa had opened the curtains and the
volets, and Rosemary saw a dull, grey sky before her. The storm had
certainly abated, but it was still raining. Rosemary thought of the
cricket match, which would probably have to be postponed owing to
the weather, and of the disappointment this would mean to many,
especially to Peter, who had set his heart upon it.</p>

<p>During breakfast Jasper told her that he had received a note
from his agent de change at Cluj, and that the latter said in his
letter that the cricket match which should have been begun
yesterday had to be postponed owing to the weather.</p>

<p>"Steinberg goes on to say," Jasper continued, "that he had heard
that the cricket pitch—the playground he calls it—was
like a swamp. The storm seems to have been very severe the other
side of the frontier. It went on for twenty-four hours without a
break, and was still raging at the time of writing. Unless the
weather improves very much, Steinberg says that the match will have
to be abandoned altogether, as Payson and several of his team have
to be back in Budapest in time for work on Monday morning, which
means leaving Hódmezö on the Sunday."</p>

<p>Then, as Rosemary made no comment on the news, only stared
rather dejectedly out of the window, Jasper went on after
awhile:</p>

<p>"I am afraid it will mean a disappointment all round, as the
weather can hardly be said to have improved, can it?"</p>

<p>Rosemary said: "No, it cannot," after which the subject was
dropped. Somehow the idea of the postponed cricket match worried
her, and there was one insistent thought which would force itself
into the forefront of her mind to the exclusion of all others, and
that was the thought that the postponed cricket match would have
left Peter free yesterday to come over to Kis-Imre, and that
therefore it might have been himself in the flesh who was standing
during the storm in the garden last night.</p>

<p>Why he should have chosen to stand in the garden in the rain
rather than come into his aunt's house was a problem which Rosemary
felt herself too wearied and disheartened to tackle.</p>

<p>When she went downstairs soon after ten o'clock she met Elza in
the hall, dressed ready to go out. She looked more tired, more
aged, more ill than the day before; obviously she had spent another
sleepless night. But she kissed Rosemary very tenderly. "Come into
the smoking-room, darling," she said. "I want to say something to
you."</p>

<p>Rosemary followed her into the smoking-room and at once asked
after Maurus.</p>

<p>"He has had no sleep," Elza said, "and at times his brain
wanders. But physically he seems no worse—rather stronger, I think,
than yesterday, and he enjoyed his breakfast. If we could only keep
him quiet!"</p>

<p>She opened her handbag and took out the papers which Rosemary
gave her yesterday.</p>

<p>"I read your articles through very carefully, dear," she said,
"but I did not have to pray for guidance. I knew at once, that none
of us, not Maurus or I, or Anna's people, would accept the
children's safety at such a price. The children themselves would
refuse."</p>

<p>With a perfectly steady hand she held the papers out to
Rosemary. "Take them, darling," she said. "Thank you for letting me
decide. This is the one thing which we none of us would have
forgiven, if you had published these articles without consulting
us."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 33</h2>

<p>Half an hour later!</p>

<p>Rosemary thought that Jasper was still in his room, and she had
a longing to get away from his nearness and out into the open. It
was still raining and the sky was the colour of lead. She threw a
cape over her shoulders and opened the door of her room. She was
dreading to meet Jasper again, so she listened intently for awhile
for any sound that might betray his presence. From Maurus'
apartments at the opposite end of the gallery there came a buzz of
voices, and from down below where the servants were laying the
table in the dining-room for luncheon a clatter of crockery.
Otherwise silence. And no sound from Jasper's room close by, so
Rosemary ran quickly downstairs.</p>

<p>She had just reached the hall intending to go out into the
garden when she heard a strange clatter coming apparently from the
smoking-room. It sounded like a scuffle. Of course it could not be,
but that was just what it sounded like. She stood still to listen.
And then she heard quite distinctly a smothered cry. Something like
a curse. And she thought that she recognized Jasper's harsh voice.
At once she ran to the door of the smoking-room and threw it
open.</p>

<p>Jasper was on the ground, struggling to get back to his feet. He
appeared dazed, and to be moving with difficulty. His hand was
tearing at his collar, as if he were choking; his clothes were
disarranged, his face looked pallid and blotchy, and his eyes
bloodshot. But Rosemary did not scream when she caught sight of
him. Something else that she had seen had paralysed her limbs and
seemed actually to be holding her by the throat. The tall window
which gave on this side of the garden was wide open, and in a
flash, just as she entered the room, Rosemary had seen Peter in the
act of getting over the window-sill. The next second he had
disappeared over the ledge, and she heard his footsteps crunching
on the gravel as he ran in the direction of the main gates.</p>

<p>A moment or two later Jasper had recovered his voice and the use
of his limbs.</p>

<p>"Call to the servants!" he cried in a raucous voice. "Curse that
devil—he will get away."</p>

<p>But Rosemary could not move. She could only stand where she was
in the doorway and stare at the open window. Jasper had struggled
to his feet, lurched forward and tried to push past her. He tried
to call out, but the words were choked in his throat. He put his
hand up again and tore at his collar, then he tottered and would
have fallen backwards if Rosemary had not been quick enough and
strong enough to catch him and to guide him to the nearest chair,
into which he sank, half fainting. One of the servants came across
the hall from the dining-room. Rosemary called to him to bring some
brandy.</p>

<p>"The gracious lord feels faint," she said. "Be quick, Sàndor,
will you?"</p>

<p>As soon as Sàndor had brought the brandy, Rosemary sent him
peremptorily away. Fortunately neither he nor any of the other
servants had heard anything of the scuffle, and Rosemary, for very
life, could not have said anything to them just then. She knelt
down beside Jasper and made him swallow some of the brandy.
Obviously he had not been hurt, only scared, and the scared look
was still in his eyes when he came to himself.</p>

<p>"You haven't let him go?" were the first words he uttered.</p>

<p>"Let whom go, Jasper?" Rosemary asked quietly. She rose to her
feet and offered him an arm to help him get up.</p>

<p>"That spying devil," Jasper replied, with a savage oath. "Peter
Blakeney."</p>

<p>"What in the world do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You know quite well what I mean. You must have seen him—I
told you to call the servants. Are you in collusion with him, then,
that you did not do it?"</p>

<p>"I heard a scuffle," Rosemary rejoined coldly, "when I reached
the hall. I opened the door and saw you lying on the ground. I only
had enough presence of mind to send for some brandy. Perhaps you
will tell me what else happened."</p>

<p>"What else?" he retorted, with a sneer. He had risen and gone
over to the mirror to readjust his clothes. She could see his face
in the glass, livid with passion, his eyes fixed upon her
reflection, while he fumbled with his tie and collar. But even
while she watched him she saw a change come slowly over his face.
The colour came back to his cheeks, his eyes narrowed, and an
indefinable expression crept into them. Perhaps he did not know
that Rosemary was watching; certain it is that she had never seen
such an expression on his face before—the lips parted above
the teeth, which gleamed sharp and white and gave the mouth a
cruel, wolfish look. It was all over in a moment, the next he had
swung round and faced her, apparently quite himself again, with
just the habitual expression of high-bred weariness which he always
affected.</p>

<p>"I was obviously wrong," he said coolly, "to suggest that you
were in collusion with that young devil, and for this I beg your
pardon."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be best," she retorted equally coolly, "if you were
to tell me what did happen?"</p>

<p>"Peter Blakeney sneaked in through that open window. My back was
turned that way and I heard nothing, as I was intent on reading
your manuscript. He attacked me from behind. I was taken unawares,
but I tried to put up a fight. However, he is younger and more
athletic than I am, and he knocked me down. He had already snatched
your manuscript out of my hand, and he disappeared with it the way
he came, through that open window, at the very moment that you
entered the room."</p>

<p>Rosemary had listened to this without moving a muscle. She stood
in the middle of the room as if she had been turned to stone, alive
only by her eyes, which were fixed with such an intensity of
questioning on Jasper that instinctively he turned away, as if
dreading to meet her glance.</p>

<p>"That is all, my dear," he said, with a sudden assumption of
meekness. "I was certainly to blame for allowing that precious
manuscript to be taken from me. I should, I know, have guarded it
with my life, and so on, and I have probably sunk very low in your
estimation as a coward. But I was taken entirely unawares, and one
is not usually prepared for daylight robbery in a house filled with
servants. So that must be my excuse—" He paused a moment,
then added drily: "That and the fact that I warned you more than
once that Peter Blakeney was working against you. Now perhaps you
are convinced."</p>

<p>At last Rosemary recovered the use of her tongue, but her voice
sounded strange to herself, toneless and distant, as if it came
from beneath the earth. "You are quite sure, I suppose," she said
slowly, "that it was Peter Blakeney who—who did what you
say?"</p>

<p>"Aren't you?" he retorted with a harsh laugh.</p>

<p>She made no reply to the taunt. Outwardly she did not even
wince.</p>

<p>"You are quite sure that he got away with the manuscript?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "I am quite sure," he replied.</p>

<p>"What do you supposed he means to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Sell it to Naniescu, of course."</p>

<p>"In exchange for Philip and Anna's freedom?"</p>

<p>Jasper looked at his wife keenly for a moment or two, and the
corners of his lips curled in a satiric smile. He took out his
cigar-case, carefully selected a weed, struck a match, lit his
cigar, and blew out the flame. Then only did he reply.</p>

<p>"Hardly that, I think, seeing that he was instrumental in
getting them locked up. More probably, I should say, in exchange
for a few thousand pounds."</p>

<p>This time the shaft struck home. Rosemary had some difficulty in
smothering the cry of protest which had risen to her throat. But
she recovered herself in less than a second and said coolly:</p>

<p>"The manuscript must be got back, of course."</p>

<p>Once more Jasper shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It might have been done at the moment; but I was helpless, and
you were so concerned for my welfare that you did not raise hell to
send the servants after the thief."</p>

<p>"I did not know then—about the manuscript."</p>

<p>"You know now," he retorted, "and have not called the servants
yet."</p>

<p>"This is not the business of the servants. I look to you to get
me back the manuscript."</p>

<p>"To me?" he rejoined with a harsh laugh. "Are you not putting to
great a strain on my allegiance? You know my views. Should I not
rather be wishing that damnable spy God-speed?"</p>

<p>"Jasper," she said earnestly, "you must get me back the
manuscript."</p>

<p>"How is that to be done, my dear? From all accounts our friend
Peter is as elusive as his ancestor, the Scarlet Pimpernel. He has
ten minutes; advance of us already...a car probably waiting for him
in the village. Are you quite sure you can't hear the whirring of a
motor now?"</p>

<p>"You could try, at any rate." And now there was a distinct note
of pleading in her voice. "General Naniescu—"</p>

<p>"Give yourself no illusion in that quarter, my dear," he broke
in quickly. "Once Naniescu is in possession of those precious
articles of yours he will send a courier flying across Europe with
them. Remember that with the manuscript there was your covering
letter to the editor of The Times, asking for immediate
publication. Let me see," he went on slowly, "this is Saturday. I
believe we shall see the first of those wonderful articles in print
in The Times on Wednesday."</p>

<p>"I don't care how it's done," she replied impatiently. "If you
won't help me I'll manage alone."</p>

<p>"What can you do, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Telegraph to The Times, for one thing, and start for London
this evening."</p>

<p>"Plucky!" he remarked drily; "But I doubt if you'll
succeed."</p>

<p>"Will you put obstacles in my way?"</p>

<p>"I? Certainly not. But Naniescu will." Then, as without
attempting further argument she turned to go, he added blandly:
"And Peter."</p>

<p>To this final taunt Rosemary made no reply. Her thoughts were in
a whirl, but through the very confusion that was raging in her
brain her resolution remained clear. She would wire to the editor
of The Times not to act on any letter he might receive from her
until he heard from her again, and in the meantime she would start
for London immediately. Even if her wire were stopped by Naniescu's
orders, she would be in London in time to stop the publication of
the articles. Though she had a great deal of influence in the
journalistic world, it was not likely that so important a paper as
The Times would be ready to print her articles the moment they were
received. Yes, she had plenty of time. And the whole conspiracy,
whatever it was, had been clumsily engineered and would certainly
prove futile.</p>

<p>The conspiracy! Rosemary could not think of that. Yet when she
did it would mean such a terrible heartache that the whole world
would become a blank. Peter blotted out of her life. That is what
it would mean to her probably in the train, travelling alone across
Europe, hurrying to nullify work done by Peter—shameful,
despicable work that would sully the reputation of a pariah. The
work of a spy, of hands tainted with ill-gotten wealth! Rosemary's
gorge rose at the thought. The conspiracy would prove futile—there
was plenty of time to subvert it—but it was an evil, noisome
thing that had been. It had existed—and Peter had given it
birth!</p>

<p>Peter!</p>

<p>Never again could the world be bright and beautiful. The thing
was so loathsome that it would taint with its foulness everything
that Rosemary had up to this hour looked on as sweet and sacred and
dear. She herself would remain noisome: a body to execrate, since
it had once lain passive and willing in Peter's arms, since her
lips still retained the savour of his kiss.</p>

<p>Rosemary went out into the village as far as the post office.
She wrote out her telegram to the editor of The Times and asked
whether it could be sent out immediately. In order to stimulate the
zeal of the postmistress she emphasized her instructions with a
hundred lei note. The post-mistress smiled and thanked the gracious
lady for the note, and she promised that she would send the
telegram off within the next few minutes. Then, as soon as Rosemary
had gone out of the stuffy little office and disappeared down the
village street, the woman rang up at the Imrey Palace at Cluj and
asked to be allowed to speak with His Excellency the General.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 34</h2>

<p>Rosemary's wire was repeated over the telephone to General
Naniescu, who promptly gave orders that it should not be sent. When
he put down the receiver he was very much puzzled. Something had
apparently happened at Kis-Imre which had greatly disturbed the
beautiful Uno. It seemed indeed as if she had actually written
those articles which Naniescu wanted so badly that he was prepared
to pay ten thousand pounds sterling of Government money for them.
And having written the articles, the lady seemed first to have sent
them off, then to have repented.</p>

<p>Well, well! It was all very puzzling. Even M. de Kervoisin,
experienced diplomat though he was, could suggest no solution. He
advised the obvious: to wait and see.</p>

<p>"We shall see our friend Number Ten soon," he said. "If I am not
mistaken he has at least one key to the puzzle in his
possession."</p>

<p>But it was not Number Ten who presented himself at the Imrey
palace that afternoon. It was <i>ce cher</i> Monsieur Blakeney, who
had come all the way from England in order to preside over a game
of cricket that had not come off because of the weather. His
Excellency was delighted to see him, and so was M. de Kervoisin.
This charming, most unexpected but most welcome visit was due no
doubt to the cricket and the bad weather. So tiresome! <i>Mais
hélas!</i> Man proposes and the rain disposes.</p>

<p>His Excellency was most sympathetic. Would M. Blakeney have a
cigar and a glass of fine? No? Then what could His Excellency do
for M. Blakeney.</p>

<p>"Pray command men, my dear Monsieur Blakeney. We are all so
grateful to you for the kind interest you are taking in our young
athletes. It will be such a happy recollection for them in after
years that so distinguished an English champion as yourself has
helped them with their games."</p>

<p>Peter let him talk on. He thought it a pity to stem this flood
of eloquence, and he was looking forward to the moment when
Naniescu's complacent effusions would turn to equally comic
puzzlement first, and subsequently to amazement and delight.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell your Excellency now," he said as soon as he could
get a word in edgeways, "why I have come?"</p>

<p>"<i>Mais comment donc?</i>" the general replied suavely. "I am
hanging on your lips, <i>mon cher</i> Monsieur Blakeney."</p>

<p>"Well," Peter said, quite slowly and speaking in French since M.
de Kervoisin did not know English. "Well, it's just this. Lady
Tarkington has written certain newspaper articles, which you,
general, very much desire to see published. That's so, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>But though this opening almost betrayed Naniescu into an
exclamation of surprise, he had enough control over his nerves not
to give himself away. Fortunately he was a great adept at
expressive gestures and his cigar also helped to keep him in
countenance.</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair, was silent for a moment or two
blowing rings of smoke through his full, red lips.</p>

<p>"Articles?" he queried at last with an assumption of perfect
indifference. "I don't know. What articles do you mean, <i>cher
ami?</i>"</p>

<p>"Those," Peter replied with equal indifference, "for which you
were prepared to pay a deuced lot of money to your
spy-in-chief."</p>

<p>Naniescu waved his podgy hand that held the cigar, then he
deliberately dusted away a modicum of ash that had dropped upon his
trousers.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said innocently. "Lady Tarkington, you say, has written
such articles?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She has."</p>

<p>"Then no doubt she will honour me by allowing me to see the
manuscript. She knows how deeply I am interested in her work."</p>

<p>"No, general," Peter broke in drily. "Lady Tarkington has no
intention of allowing you to see that particular manuscript of
hers."</p>

<p>"Ah! May I be permitted to inquire how you happen to know
that?"</p>

<p>"I happen to know—no matter how—that Lady Tarkington
only wrote the articles tentatively; that after she had written
them she repented having done so, and that her next act would have
been to throw the manuscript into the fire."</p>

<p>"Very interesting. But, forgive me, my dear Monsieur Blakeney,
if I ask you in what way all this concerns you?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," Peter said coolly. "I also happen to
know—no matter how—that you are prepared to pay a large
sum of money for those articles, so I thought that I would
forestall your spy-in-chief by driving a bargain with you over the
manuscript."</p>

<p>"But how can you do that, my dear young friend, without the
manuscript in your possession?"</p>

<p>"The manuscript is in my possession, Excellency," Peter said
coolly.</p>

<p>"How did that come about, if I may ask the question?"</p>

<p>"You may. I stole it this morning from Lady Tarkington."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Naniescu had given such a jump that he nearly turned himself out
of his chair. The cigar fell from between his fingers, and the
glass that contained the fine was upset and its contents spilt over
the table. Even M. de Kervoisin had given a start; and his pale,
expressionless face had flushed. Though the report of the
post-mistress of Kis-Imre had given Naniescu an inkling that
something unexpected had occurred, he certainly had not been
prepared for this.</p>

<p>He looked up at Peter and frowned, trying to recover his dignity
which had been seriously jeopardized. Peter was laughing—very
impolitely, thought His Excellency. But then these English have no
manners.</p>

<p>"You'll forgive my smiling, won't you, sir?" asked Peter quite
deferentially.</p>

<p>"Go on with your story," Naniescu retorted gruffly. "Never mind
your manners."</p>

<p>"I can't very well mind them, sir," Peter rejoined, with utmost
seriousness, "as I don't possess any. And I can't go on with my
story because there is none to tell."</p>

<p>"You have got to tell me how you knew that Lady Tarkington had
written certain newspaper articles; how you knew that I wanted
them; how you came to—to steal them—the word is your
own, my dear Monsieur Blakeney—and where they are at the
present moment."</p>

<p>"None of which facts, I am thinking, concern your Excellency,"
Peter retorted coolly, "except the last. The manuscript of Lady
Tarkington's newspaper articles is in my pocket at the present
moment, together with her letter to the editor of The Times, asking
for these articles to be published at an early opportunity. So, you
see, sir, that I am bringing you a perfectly sound
proposition."</p>

<p>"I'll have to read those articles first."</p>

<p>"Of course," Peter agreed, and took the sheets of manuscript out
of his pocket. "At your leisure."</p>

<p>Naniescu thrust out his podgy hand for them, his large,
expressive eyes had lit up with a gleam of excitement. Peter gave
him the manuscript, and as he did so he remarked casually, "They
are no use to your Excellency without the covering letter."</p>

<p>Which remark seemed to tickle M. de Kervoisin's fancy, for he
gave a funny, dry cackle which might pass for a laugh. Naniescu,
however, appeared not to notice the taunt. His white, downy hands
shook slightly as he unfolded the manuscript. He leaned back in his
chair and began to read, the excitement of his nerves was chiefly
apparent by his stertorous breathing and his almost savage chawing
of the stump of his cigar.</p>

<p>M. de Kervoisin remained silent. He offered Peter a cigarette,
and while the Englishman struck a match, lit the cigarette and
smoked it with obvious relish, the Frenchman watched him through
his half-closed lids with an expression of puzzlement upon his
keen, wrinkled face. No sound disturbed the silence that had fallen
over the actors of the little comedy, only the ticking of an
old-fashioned clock and now and then the crisp crackling of paper
as Naniescu turned over the sheets of the manuscript. From time to
time he nodded his head and murmured complacently, "<i>C'est très
bien! C'est même très, très bien!</i>" And once he looked across at
his friend and asked: "Would you like to read this Kervoisin?" But
the Frenchman only shrugged and replied with a slightly sarcastic
smile: "Oh, my dear friend, if you are satisfied—"</p>

<p>Peter said nothing. He waited quite patiently, seemingly
completely indifferent, and smoked one cigarette after another.</p>

<p>When Naniescu had finished reading, he carefully folded the
manuscript, laid it on the table beside him and put his hand upon
it.</p>

<p>"What do you want for this?" he asked.</p>

<p>And Peter replied coolly: "The title-deeds of the Kis-Imre
property."</p>

<p>Naniescu stared at Peter for a moment or two, then he threw back
his head and laughed until the tears trickled down his cheeks.</p>

<p>"You are astonishing, my friend," he said. "The property is
worth fifty thousand sterling."</p>

<p>"I have paid an option on it of five thousand," Peter retorted,
"and the rest of it wouldn't come out of your Excellency's pocket,
I take it."</p>

<p>"Not out of my pocket, of course," Naniescu was willing to
admit, "but out of that of my Government. We are going to sell
Kis-Imre for the benefit of the State."</p>

<p>"And won't your Excellency be purchasing these newspaper
articles for the benefit of the State?"</p>

<p>"These articles are not worth it," Naniescu retorted
gruffly.</p>

<p>"Very will, let's say no more about it. I'm sorry I troubled
your Excellency."</p>

<p>Peter rose as if to go and put out his hand toward the sheets of
manuscript.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," Naniescu broke in. "I'll give you a good
price for the thing, but a property worth fifty thousand
sterling—hang it all—it's a bit stiff."</p>

<p>Peter smiled. "How tersely you put the matter, general," he
said. "I dare say it is a bit stiff, but I am not prepared to
bargain—only to sell. And if you are not
satisfied—"</p>

<p>"Easy, easy, my impetuous young friend. Did I say that I was not
satisfied—or that I refuse to consider the matter? But there
are considerations."</p>

<p>"What considerations?"</p>

<p>"To begin with, how do I know that the English newspaper would
accept these articles as the genuine work of Lady Tarkington?"</p>

<p>"I told you that I had Lady Tarkington's own covering letter to
the editor of The Times, asking him to publish the articles as soon
as possible."</p>

<p>"Let me see it," Naniescu retorted.</p>

<p>"With pleasure."</p>

<p>Peter took the letter out of his pocket, but before handing it
over to Naniescu he said drily: "May I in the meanwhile refresh my
memory of the articles?"</p>

<p>The eyes of the two men met across the table. Naniescu's flashed
with resentment, but Peter's face wore a disarming smile. He looked
for all the world like a schoolboy bartering marbles for stamps.
But the situation appeared to tickle Kervoisin's fancy. He gave a
dry chuckle and said:</p>

<p>"You are quite right, <i>mon ami</i>. They are astonishing,
these English."</p>

<p>The exchange was effected without Naniescu losing his sense of
resentment or Peter his pleasant smile, and Peter held on to
Rosemary's manuscript while the general read the letter
through.</p>

<p>While he read, the look of resentment vanished from his face and
a complacent smile rose to his full, sensuous lips.</p>

<p>"<i>Il n'y pas à dire</i>," he murmured; "<i>c'est très, très
bien.</i>"</p>

<p>When he had finished reading he looked up at Peter.</p>

<p>"Now then, Monsieur Blakeney," he said curtly, "your last
price?"</p>

<p>"I have told you, sir—the title-deeds of Kis-Imre."</p>

<p>"You are joking."</p>

<p>"I was never more serious in my life."</p>

<p>"But, hang it all, man, if I make the property over to you, how
are we to get rid of the Imreys?"</p>

<p>Peter shrugged his shoulders, and, still smiling, said coolly:
"That, Excellency, is your affair, not mine."</p>

<p>"But the Countess Imrey is your aunt."</p>

<p>"What has that got to do with the whole thing, Excellency?"</p>

<p>"What has it got to do with it? What has it—?" Naniescu
was gasping with astonishment. He was something of a rascal
himself, but never in all his life had he come across such
callousness or such impudence. He turned to Kervoisin as much as to
say: "Have you ever seen such an unmitigated young blackguard?" But
the Frenchman's face was inscrutable; his keen, pale eyes rested
with obvious puzzlement on Peter.</p>

<p>"Then you want me," Naniescu asked, as soon as he had recovered
his breath, "you want me to turn the Imreys out of their home?"</p>

<p>"It won't be the first time, Excellency, that you have done that
sort of thing, will it?" Peter retorted, with his most engaging
smile.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, Naniescu was losing his temper. He wanted
those articles and wanted them badly, and if this preposterous deal
went through he could have them without putting his hand in his
pocket. But this young blackguard exasperated him. Perhaps
professional pride was wounded at meeting a man more corrupt, more
venal than himself. To further his own ends Naniescu would have
plundered and bullied to an unlimited extent, but he would not have
robbed and bullied his own kith and kin; whereas this handsome
young athlete with the engaging smile did not seem to have the
slightest scruple or the least pricking of conscience. It would be
a triumph to get the better of him in some sort of way.
Unfortunately the scamp had not yet given up the manuscript, and
Naniescu only had the letter, whilst de Kervoisin was in one of his
abstracted fits when he wouldn't open his mouth to give friendly
advice.</p>

<p>The general, sitting back in his chair, and blowing smoke rings
through his pursed lips, had a swift but exceedingly pleasant
day-dream. Those articles were just what he wanted. They were so
beautifully written! So convincingly! What a stir they would make!
They were a complete vindication of his administration here in
Transylvania. The country prosperous. The people contented. Only a
small minority grumbling without the slightest justification. Oh,
those articles! Published in the English Times and signed by the
illustrious "Uno"! Naniescu, closing his eyes to enjoy this
wonderful day-dream, saw himself summoned to Bucharest, there to
receive the personal thanks of his King and a substantial reward
from his Government, whilst all he need do now to obtain these
glorious results was to hand over to this young rascal a property
that belonged to that fool Maurus Imrey.</p>

<p>It was a lovely day-dream. A stroke of the pen would make it
reality. No wonder that General Naniescu swore loudly when the
crackling of paper woke him from his short trance. The young rascal
was quite unconcernedly stowing that precious manuscript away in
his pocket.</p>

<p>"Halt!" Naniescu exclaimed, on the impulse of the moment. "I
accept—" Then he added guardedly: "On principle, I mean."</p>

<p>"And in fact?" Peter queried, without making the slightest
movement towards taking the manuscript out of his pocket again.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" Naniescu replied impatiently. "But, curse you for a
jackanapes, these things take time—"</p>

<p>"They need not," Peter rejoined curtly. "All you need do is to
give me an official receipt for forty-five thousand sterling, the
balance of the purchase-money for the Kis-Imre property. The
British Consul and your lawyer will do the rest."</p>

<p>"And when do you want possession?"</p>

<p>"At once."</p>

<p>Naniescu made a final appeal to his friend: "What do you say,
Kervoisin?"</p>

<p>But the Frenchman's face remained inscrutable. He was watching
the smoke that curled upwards from the tip of his cigarette, and
only from time to time did he throw a quick, indefinable glance at
the tall, athletic figure of the man who was driving such a
contemptible bargain. When Naniescu appealed directly to him, he
only shrugged his shoulders to indicate his complete detachment
from the whole affair. Peter, on the other hand, showed not the
slightest sign of impatience. He even went to the length of
buttoning up his coat.</p>

<p>"Would you like to think it over?" he said coolly. "I can leave
my offer open for another few hours."</p>

<p>"No! damn you!" Naniescu exclaimed, and jumped to his feet.
"Wait for me here. I'll have the receipt ready in five
minutes."</p>

<p>After which, from sheer force of habit, he swore in several
other languages before he finally strode out of the room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 35</h2>

<p>Peter met de Kervoisin's shrewd eyes fixed searchingly upon him.
He gave a quaint, good-humoured laugh.</p>

<p>"Are you trying to make up your mind, sir," he asked, "just what
kind of a blackguard I am?"</p>

<p>M. de Kervoisin's thin lips curled in a wry smile. "I am not
sure," he said, "that you are a blackguard. But I confess that I do
not understand you."</p>

<p>"Which is very flattering, sir. But isn't it natural that a man
should covet a beautiful property and seize the cheapest means to
become possessed of it? That sort of thing has been largely done by
the conquering nations since the war. Then why not by
individuals?"</p>

<p>"Why not, as you say? But I was not thinking of that side of the
question, chiefly because I do not believe that you stole Lady
Tarkington's manuscript in order to drive a bargain with our friend
here over the Kis-Imre property. I may be wrong, but you don't look
to me the sort of man who would do this dirty trick for mere gain.
I am giving you the credit of desiring above all to save your
kinsfolk, young and old, from certain highly unpleasant
eventualities."</p>

<p>"You are very generous, sir, in your estimate of me."</p>

<p>"The question is," Kervoisin mused, "whether after all this they
will be grateful to you for what you have done, or will they hate
you, do you think, for what the publication of those articles will
mean to their people? Lady Tarkington must at one time have
intended to publish those articles, since she took the trouble to
write them. Something turned her from the purpose: either her own
conviction, or the desire of the Imreys themselves."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," Peter said, with a shrug of complete
indifference.</p>

<p>"Whereupon you, my dear friend, stepped in like an unwanted
<i>deus ex machina</i>, and settled the business to your own
satisfaction, if not to theirs."</p>

<p>"I never was good at Latin," Peter said, with his most engaging
smile, "but we'll leave it at that if you like."</p>

<p>De Kervoisin was silent for a moment or two, his attention being
seemingly riveted on the rings of smoke that rose from his
cigarette.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he murmured after a while.</p>

<p>"Don't trouble, sir. I am not worth it."</p>

<p>"Ah! but youth always is a perpetual wonder to me. It is such a
long time since I was young myself. And I was wondering which of
the two levers youth pulled in order to make you act as you
did."</p>

<p>"Two levers?"</p>

<p>"Love or hate."</p>

<p>Then, as Peter was silent in his turn, M. de Kervoisin went on:
"You know, we in France always look for the woman in every case.
Now here we have not far to seek. And yet love would seem to me to
have gained nothing by this adventure, whilst hate, on the other
hand—"</p>

<p>He paused abruptly, his keen eyes narrowed, and his lips curled
in a sardonic smile.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said. "I think I understand, after all."</p>

<p>"That's more than I do, sir," Peter retorted ingenuously.</p>

<p>M. de Kervoisin would no doubt have pursued the subject, which
seemed greatly to interest him, had not Naniescu just then made a
noisy re-entry into the room. He had a large, official-looking
document in his hand, which he threw down on the table.</p>

<p>"Have a look at this, my dear Monsieur Blakeney," he said
curtly. "I think that you will find it in order."</p>

<p>Peter took up the paper and examined it at great length. It was
a receipt for the sum of forty-five thousand pounds sterling, in
full satisfaction for the sale of the estate of Kis-Imre here
described as the property of the Crown of Roumania. It was signed
with Naniescu's elaborate flourish, countersigned and stamped; it
stated further that the sale would be duly inscribed in the
<i>Bureau des Hypothèques</i> in accordance with the law, and the
<i>acte de vente</i> and title-deeds handed over within one month
to M. Peter Blakeney or his duly appointed representative.</p>

<p>It was all in order. Peter folded the receipt, but before
putting it away he said to Naniescu:</p>

<p>"The whole thing, of course, is conditional on a free pardon
being granted to Philip Imrey and Anna Heves, with permission to
leave the country immediately. That was the original bargain
between yourself and Lady Tarkington."</p>

<p>"They can clear out of the country the day the last of these
articles is published in The Times," Naniescu rejoined gruffly.
"I'll arrange for that fool Maurus Imrey and his wife to clear out
at the same time. The sooner I am rid of the whole brood of them,
the better I shall like it."</p>

<p>"I am sure you will," Peter said blandly. "Then perhaps you
won't mind letting me have passports for them. You can post-date
them, of course. I shouldn't then have to intrude on you
again."</p>

<p>"You are very kind. The passports post-dated, say, a week from
to-day will be in the bureau at your disposal whenever you like to
call for them. You understand that I should revoke them if at least
one of these articles has not appeared within the week."</p>

<p>"I quite understand," Peter concluded. Everything now being in
order, he slipped the receipt into his pocket-book, then, without
further words, he handed Rosemary's manuscript over to
Naniescu.</p>

<p>"You have the covering letter," he said simply.</p>

<p>Naniescu nodded, and he took the papers with a sigh of
satisfaction, which he did not even attempt to disguise. His
ill-temper had vanished. The day-dream was coming true: the journey
to Bucharest, the thanks of his King, the reward from a grateful
Government! Naniescu felt at peace with all the world. He would
even have hugged Peter to his breast.</p>

<p>"We part the best of friends," he said suavely, "my dear
Monsieur Blakeney."</p>

<p>"Oh! the very best," Peter assented.</p>

<p>"And when you come to take possession of Kis-Imre you will
command my services, I hope. "</p>

<p>"I shall not fail to do so."</p>

<p>"I will see to it that you can do it at the earliest possible
moment. By the way," Naniescu went on with some hesitation, "the
furniture—and other contents of the château—they are
not included in the sale, of course."</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"You won't mind the Imreys having those? It might create an
unpleasant impression—if we were to—er—"</p>

<p>"It might," Peter assented.</p>

<p>"I was sure you would agree with me about that," Naniescu
rejoined unctuously. "Then what would you like us to do in the
matter?"</p>

<p>"Leave everything as it is until you hear from me again. The
British Consul will look after things for me."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Naniescu concluded with perfect affability, "then I don't
think I need detain you any longer, my dear young friend. May I
express the wish that you will spend long and happy years in this
beautiful country."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>Peter did not shake hands with either of the two men, but he
caught Kervoisin's glance and gave him a pleasant nod. To Naniescu
he said just before leaving:</p>

<p>"I suppose you have realized that Lady Tarkington will probably
wish to start for England immediately."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear young friend," Naniescu replied blandly. "I had
realized that, and I have taken measures accordingly. But how kind
of you to remind me!"</p>

<p>And when Peter finally went out of the room the general,
breathless, perspiring, nerve-racked, threw himself into a chair
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"<i>Il n'y a pas à dire!</i> They are astonishing, these
English!"</p>

<p>He poured himself out a glass of fine and drank it down at one
gulp.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such an unmitigated young blackguard?" he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>But de Kervoisin had remained thoughtful. His shrewd, pale eyes
were fixed upon the door through which Peter had just disappeared.
Naniescu had taken his handkerchief and was mopping his streaming
forehead and his neck round the edge of his collar.</p>

<p>"I feel quite sick," he murmured. "Ah, these English! <i>mon
ami</i>. You don't know them as I do. I firmly believe that they
would sell their fathers, their mothers, their sisters, or their
wives if they saw money in the transaction."</p>

<p>Kervoisin made no comment on this tirade; after a while he asked
abruptly: "What are you doing to prevent the lovely Uno from
putting a spoke in your wheel?"</p>

<p>Naniescu gave a complacent laugh.</p>

<p>"Doing?" he retorted. "Why, I've already done everything, my
friend. My courier starts to-night for London with Lady
Tarkington's letter and manuscript. He will be in London on Monday
evening. On Tuesday he will call on the editor of The Times.
Ostensibly he is Lady Tarkington's messenger. When he has delivered
the letter he will ask for a reply. That reply he will telegraph to
me. Then we shall know where we are."</p>

<p>He drank another glass of fine, then he went on:</p>

<p>"I have no doubt that the fair Uno has already got her boxes
packed and is ready to start for England by the express to-night,
but—"</p>

<p>Naniescu paused. He stretched out his legs, examined the toes of
his boots and the smoke of his cigar; his face wore an expression
of fatuous self-satisfaction. "I think," he said, "that you will be
surprised at what I have done in the time. And so will the
incomparable Uno," he added with an expressive twinkle in his fine,
dark eyes.</p>

<p>"What about friend Number Ten?" Kervoisin remarked drily.</p>

<p>"Well," Naniescu retorted with his affected smile, "I imagine
that friend Number Ten will be the most surprised of the lot."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 36</h2>

<p>At Kis-Imre the day dragged on leaden-footed. Luncheon, then a
long afternoon, then dinner. Time wore on and Elza had not
returned.</p>

<p>Rosemary was ready, dressed for the journey; her suit-case was
packed. She was only taking a very little luggage with her as she
had every intention of returning as soon as her errand in London
was accomplished. She would not for the world have left Elza alone
too long with her troubles. She made herself no illusions with
regard to the telegram which she had sent from the village. It
would, she was sure, be intercepted, and Naniescu would not allow
it to go. Rosemary's intention was to send another directly she was
the other side of the frontier. This would prevent the articles
being published hurriedly, and, of course, she would be in London
thirty-six hours later.</p>

<p>Indeed, the odious deed which Peter had planned and carried
through appeared to her now not only in its hideousness but in its
futility. What did he hope to accomplish? Did he know her so little
as to imagine that she would merely call the occurrence an adverse
blow of Fate and quietly sit down under it—be content to send
one wire which would be intercepted? It was futile! Futile! She was
a British subject. She had a British passport. No power on earth
could stop her from going to London or to the outermost ends of the
earth if she had a mind. No one. Not even Jasper. Least of all
Jasper!</p>

<p>But in the meanwhile Elza had not returned. Time went on, slowly
but certainly. Eight o'clock—nine o'clock—ten o'clock.
Unless Elza was home within the next half-hour Rosemary could not
start for London before the next night. There was only one through
train to Budapest every twenty-four hours, the midnight express!
Any other slow train would be no help for getting the communication
with the Orient Express.</p>

<p>And Rosemary could not go to London without knowing what Elza's
wishes were. Elza was to decide—not she. And Elza had not
come back from Anna's mother. Soon after ten Rosemary sent Rosa
round to Maurus to ask if she might see him. She hoped that he
could perhaps tell her something definite about Elza's movements.
Rosemary found him very much altered since last she had seen him.
He looked well in health, but his whole expression, even his
appearance, seemed strange. The gipsy strain was more
apparent—the eyes seemed darker and more restless, the mouth
redder and fuller, and the nose more hooked and narrower across the
bridge. But he talked very quietly about Elza, because he had not
really expected to see her back this evening.</p>

<p>"She was going to Cluj first," he said, "to see Philip and Anna.
Probably it took time to get permission to visit the children in
prison. Then after that she was going to Ujlak. I suppose she
wanted to let Charlotte know how little Anna is getting on. Poor
child! Poor child!" Maurus went on slowly, wagging his head. "Isn't
it pitiable? She is such a nice little girl. And my Philip—my
Philip—"</p>

<p>He rambled on, and his speech became thick and unintelligible.
The sister in charge gave Rosemary a hint that it would be better
for her to go. Rosemary rose at once.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Maurus," she said, "I don't want to tire you. I
thought perhaps you might know something definite about Elza. But
if you are not anxious about her I am sure it is all right."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, it is all right. You see, she went to visit the
children. Then she was going to Ujlak. It is a long way for the
horses—"</p>

<p>"You don't think she would stay in Cluj for the night?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I don't know. She was going to Cluj first to see
the children—then she was going to Ujlak. It is a long way
for the horses—Elza will stay with Charlotte for the night. A
hard woman, Charlotte. But Anna is such a nice child. And my
Philip—my Philip—"</p>

<p>The mind was obviously wandering. Maurus, while he spoke was
staring straight out before him. Rosemary tried to explain to him
that she had to go away on business for a day or two and she hoped
to start this evening, but she could not go, of course, without
seeing Elza first.</p>

<p>"Ah! you are going away, dear Lady Tarkington?" the invalid said
with a quick gleam in his restless, dark eyes. "I wish I could go
with you. I am so sick of this place, and now that my Philip has
gone...But how can you go to-night, dear Lady Tarkington?"</p>

<p>"I won't go before I have seen Elza."</p>

<p>"No, no, you must not go before Elza comes. I have only the one
comfortable carriage now. They have taken everything from me, my
horses, my cattle, my carriages, and my motor-cars—I can't
send you to Cluj in comfort until Elza comes back in the carriage.
I have another pair of horses—but no comfortable carriage.
They took everything away from me. Soon they will turn me out of
this house—"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that, dear, my husband has the use of a small
car and a soldier-chauffeur. We can get to Cluj all right."</p>

<p>The sister in charge interposed again, more peremptorily this
time. Rosemary took as cheerful a farewell of the invalid as she
could.</p>

<p>"You must arrange," she said, "As soon as you are well enough,
to come over to us in England for a visit. It would be such a
change for you, and Jasper and I would make you and Elza very
welcome."</p>

<p>But Maurus shook his head, and stared straight out before him.
"That, dear Lady Tarkington," he said, "can never be now." And
slowly the tears gathered in his eyes and trickled down his cheeks.
Broken-hearted, Rosemary bade him a final good night.</p>

<p>There was only one more chance of getting in touch with Elza
to-night, and that was to ascertain if she were staying at any of
the hotels in Cluj. And this Jasper did at Rosemary's request. He
telephoned to the "Pannonia" and to the "New York", the only
possible places where Elza might have put up for the night. True,
when the Roumanian Government took over the Imrey palace two or
three rooms were allowed to remain in possession of the family if
they required them, but it was not likely that Elza would elect to
sleep under the same roof as General Naniescu. Both hotels replied
on the telephone that the gracious Countess Imrey was not there.
Ujlak, unfortunately, had not the telephone installed.</p>

<p>There was, then, nothing to be done.</p>

<p>But the next day was even more trying than the one before. The
morning wore on and there was no news of Elza. Anxiety for her
friend was added to the heavy load which Rosemary had to bear.
Anxiety and this unexpected uncertainty, which was positive
torture.</p>

<p>Jasper, on the other hand, had become both helpful and
sympathetic. Already the day before he had announced his intention
of accompanying Rosemary to London. At first she had protested, but
he looked so contrite and so abashed that she relented, and said
more graciously:</p>

<p>"It is more than kind of you, dear, to suggest it, but I really
am quite capable of looking after myself."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it," he had replied with a sigh, "but I, too,
have certain privileges, chief of which is looking after your
welfare—and your safety."</p>

<p>She laughed. "I am perfectly safe. No one is going to run away
with me."</p>

<p>"You might have trouble on the frontier."</p>

<p>"Not very likely," she retorted, "with a British passport."</p>

<p>Jasper had made no further remark just then, and the subject was
dropped. But Rosemary knew from his manner and his look that he
intended to accompany her. It would be no use protesting, though
she had the feeling that she would so much rather have travelled
alone.</p>

<p>But when the morning of the next day went by without news of
Elza, Jasper was ready with a fresh suggestion. "Let me go to
London for you," he said. "I could see the editor of The Times and
ask him in any case to withhold publication until he heard from
you. Then after that, if Elza's decision went the other way, you
could always wire or write again."</p>

<p>Rosemary hesitated for a moment or two. She could not very well
put into words the thought that was in her mind. But Jasper
presently did it for her.</p>

<p>"You do not trust me," he said quietly.</p>

<p>For another fraction of a second she hesitated, then with a
frank gesture of camaraderie she put her hand out to him: "I think
I ought to carry my own business through myself," she said, and
added softly: "You understand, dear, don't you?"</p>

<p>She could always win any man over with her smile, and at the
soft tone of her voice Jasper captured her hand and buried his face
in the soft, smooth palm.</p>

<p>"Tell me how I can serve you," he said, "but, in God's name,
don't go away from me."</p>

<p>He was once more all kindness and consideration, more like the
charming companion of the early days of her brief married life.
With utmost patience he discussed the whole situation with her: the
possibility of getting in touch with Elza and the advisability of
communicating with The Times in any case, leaving it open for an
ultimate change of tactics.</p>

<p>But though he was so kind, so unselfish, so generous, Rosemary
could not respond in the same way as she had done in the past. Her
confidence in him had been wavering for some time, whenever those
wild outbursts of ungovernable passion, when he claimed her body
and her soul as he would a slave or a chattel, had outraged as well
as mystified her, and she could not free her mind from that vision
which she had of him in the mirror yesterday, with his mouth parted
in a cruel, wolfish grin. The dual nature in him puzzled her. She
would not admit that she feared him, because she had never in her
life been afraid of anyone, but she did own to a certain vague
dread which would creep into her heart whenever she found herself
alone with him; she had accepted his kisses at first, hoping that
in time friendship and confidence would turn to warmer feeling, but
she had a horror of them now, and knew that the last shred of
friendship was being torn to rags by all that was violent,
passionate and cruel in him. At the same time she did admit quite
readily that he was very helpful and kind in the present emergency,
and gladly did she accept his final offer to motor straightway to
Cluj to see if he could find out something definite about Elza.</p>

<p>"If she was not at Cluj," he said, "I would go on to Ujlak; and,
in any case, I can be back by about eight o'clock. If in the
meanwhile, as I hope and think, Elza has turned up, we can make our
plans in accordance with what she has decided, and either start for
England at once, or leave matters as they stand."</p>

<p>The suggestion was so practical that Rosemary felt really
grateful. She walked with him to the village where he garaged the
car that Naniescu had leant him. It was a powerful little car, of a
well-known French make and built for speed. The soldier-chauffeur
was fortunately on the spot, and with a friendly handshake Rosemary
wished her husband God-speed.</p>

<p>"I don't know how I shall live through this day!" she said to
him at the last.</p>

<p>Jasper was very self-contained and practical. He satisfied
himself that everything about the car was in order, then only did
he get in. He took the wheel and waved Rosemary a last farewell,
and very soon the car disappeared down the road in a cloud of
dust.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 37</h2>

<p>General Naniescu was enjoying himself thoroughly. He had his
friend Number Ten sitting there opposite him, and Number Ten was
looking as savage as a bear. Naniescu had offered him a cigar, a
glass of fine, even whisky and soda, but Number Ten had declined
everything and remained very truculent.</p>

<p>"You had no right," he said, with a savage oath, "to go behind
my back."</p>

<p>But Naniescu was at his blandest. "What could I do, my dear
friend?" he asked, and waived his white, downy hands to emphasize
by appropriate gesture, both his perplexity and his contrition.
"What would you have had me do? Decline to deal with that young
Blakeney? Then those precious articles would have been lost to me
for ever. Lady Tarkington would not have written them all over
again."</p>

<p>"I told you the other day that I would get those articles for
you. Ask M. de Kervoisin here if I have ever failed in anything I
have undertaken. I had the manuscript in my hand when that young
blackguard snatched it out of my hand. Curse him!"</p>

<p>Naniescu leaned back in his chair and gave a guttural,
complacent laugh: "I do agree with you, my dear friend," he said.
"That young Blakeney is an unmitigated blackguard. I have had to
deal with some in my day, but never with such a corrupt, dirty
scoundrel. Yes, dirty, that's what he is. But you know, you
English, you are astonishing! Everything big with you—big
fellows, big Empire, big money, big blackguards! Yes, big
blackguards! <i>Oh, là, là!</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes," Number Ten assented drily. "And the big blackguard who is
also a big fellow, got big money out of you, for you have been a
fool, as well as a knave, my friend. I only asked you ten thousand
sterling for the manuscript."</p>

<p>"Are you pretending that you know what I paid Blakeney?"
Naniescu asked, with his most fatuous smile. "Because, my friend,
in picturesque poker parlance—I am very fond of a game of
poker myself—and in poker language, we call what you are
doing now 'bluff.' You don't know what I paid Blakeney for the
manuscript. But I don't mind telling you that I paid nothing at
all. Yes, my dear friend, nothing at all."</p>

<p>And with the tip of his well-manicured little finger, Naniescu
emphasized every syllable with a tap on the table.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it," Number Ten retorted curtly, "because
that will make it easier for you to pay me the ten thousand
now."</p>

<p>But this idea amused the General so much that he nearly rolled
off his chair laughing.</p>

<p>"<i>Ils sont impayable ces Anglais!</i>" he said, when with
streaming eyes and scanty breath he found words to express his
sense of the ludicrous. "Why in the name of Tophet should I pay you
ten thousand pounds sterling?"</p>

<p>"Because if you don't, those newspaper articles will never be
published."</p>

<p>"Ah, bah!" Naniescu exclaimed with a mocking grin, "who will
prevent it?"</p>

<p>"I, of course."</p>

<p>"You, of course? How, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"That's my business."</p>

<p>"You can't do it, my friend," Naniescu rejoined complacently.
"You can't do it. I defy you to do it."</p>

<p>"Is that a challenge?"</p>

<p>Number Ten had said this very quietly. He was in the act of
lighting a cigarette when he spoke, and he finished lighting it,
blew out the match, and threw it into the nearest ash-tray before
he glanced at Naniescu. Then he smiled, because Naniescu's face
expressed arrogance first, then bewilderment, and finally
indecision.</p>

<p>"Is it a challenge?" he reiterated sardonically. "I don't mind,
you know, one way or the other. There are at least three
governments—neighbours of yours, by the way—who will
pay me ten thousand pounds apiece for certain services which they
require, and which I can render them. But you have behaved like a
knave and a fool, my friend, and it will amuse me to punish you. So
listen to me! Unless you give me a cheque for the ten thousand
pounds which you promised me, and which I can cash at your fusty
old bank over the way this very afternoon, I guarantee you that
Lady Tarkington's articles will not be published in any English
newspaper."</p>

<p>He smoked on in silence for a little while longer, blowing rings
of smoke through his pursed lips, and in the intervals laughing
softly, mockingly to himself, or throwing an occasional glance of
intelligence in the direction of Kervoisin, who apparently immersed
in a book had taken no part in the conversation. Naniescu's
bewilderment had become ludicrous, and at one moment when he took
his perfumed handkerchief out of his pocket and mopped his
streaming forehead, the face of his spy-in-chief became distorted
with that look of ferocious cruelty which was so characteristic of
him.</p>

<p>"I haven't a great deal of time to spare," Number Ten remarked
drily, after a few minutes' silence; "if you accept my challenge I
start for London to-night."</p>

<p>"You'll never get there in time," Naniescu rejoined, with an
attempt at swagger.</p>

<p>Number Ten smiled. "Don't you think so?" he asked simply.</p>

<p>"The frontier is closed—"</p>

<p>"Would you rather risk it than pay me the ten thousand
pounds?"</p>

<p>Naniescu appealed to his friend.</p>

<p>"De Kervoisin—" he said, almost pitiably.</p>

<p>But M. de Kervoisin, with a shrug, indicated that this was no
concern of his.</p>

<p>"M. de Kervoisin," Number Ten said, still smiling, "knows my
methods. During the war I had other and more dangerous frontiers to
cross than this one, my friend—and I never failed."</p>

<p>In Naniescu's puny mind, obviously a war was waging between
greed and avarice. He was seeing his beautiful day-dream vanishing
into the intangible ether—whence come all dreams—and he
was not prepared to take any risks. Those articles which a reliable
courier was even now taking to London with all speed were the most
precious things he, Naniescu, had ever possessed. They meant
honour, security, money—far more money than Number Ten was
demanding with such outrageous impudence. And Naniescu was afraid
of Number Ten—afraid of his daring, is courage, his
unscrupulous determination to carry through what he had set out to
do.</p>

<p>Ten thousand pounds! It was a great deal, but it would come out
of secret service funds, not out of Naniescu's own pocket. There
was only that slight desire to get the better of Number Ten, to win
this battle of wits against so crafty an opponent. But what was
<i>amour propre</i> when weighed in the balance with the
realization of Naniescu's wonderful daydreams?</p>

<p>Nevertheless he made one more effort at a bargain.</p>

<p>"If I pay you that the thousand," he said, with a savage oath,
"what guarantee have I that the articles will be published?"</p>

<p>"None," was Number Ten's cool reply; "but if you don't pay me
the ten thousand, I guarantee that they will not be published."</p>

<p>At which M. de Kervoisin put down his book and indulged in a
good laugh.</p>

<p>"Take care, my friend," he said to Number Ten, "our friend here
is beginning to lose his temper, and you may find yourself under
lock and key before he has done with you."</p>

<p>"I wonder!" Number Ten retorted drily "It would mean raising
hell in the English press, wouldn't it? if a British
subject—what?"</p>

<p>He did not pursue the subject. Even Naniescu himself had put
such a possibility out of his reckoning.</p>

<p>"All that our friend could do," Number Ten went on, speaking
over his shoulder to M. de Kervoisin, "would be to have me
murdered, but he would find even that rather difficult. Ten
thousand pounds of secret service money is considerably
safer—and cheaper in the end."</p>

<p>Then at last Naniescu gave in. "Oh, have it your own way, curse
you!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"The money now," Number Ten said coolly, raising a warning
finger. "You may as well send one of your clerks over to the bank
for it. I prefer that to taking your cheque."</p>

<p>Then he turned to Kervoisin, and picked up the book which the
latter had thrown down on the table "Ah!" he remarked, with a total
change of tone, "Marcel Proust's latest. You are an epicure in
literature, my friend."</p>

<p>He fingered the book, seemingly as indifferent to what Naniescu
was doing and saying, as if the whole matter of a ten thousand
pound cheque did not concern him in the least.</p>

<p>The general had gone across to a desk which stood in the farther
corner of the room. He had written out a cheque, rung the bell, and
was now giving orders to a clerk to fetch the money from the
Anglo-Roumanian bank over the way.</p>

<p>On the whole he was not displeased with the transaction. The
articles signed by Uno and published in The Times would redound to
his credit, would bring him all that he had striven for all his
life; and, after all, they would cost him nothing—nothing at
all.</p>

<p>Number Ten and de Kervoisin were discussing Marcel Proust; he,
Naniescu, was savouring his day-dreams once again; and presently
when the clerk returned with a bundle of crisp English bank-notes
in his hand, Naniescu handed the money over to his spy-in-chief
without a qualm, and certainly without regret.</p>

<p>"This being Monday," Number Ten said, after he had stowed the
money away in his pocket-book, "and your courier having started
last night, you will probably see the first of the articles in
Thursday's Times. By the way," he went on casually, "what are you
doing about young Imrey and the girl?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that? What should I be doing with
them?"</p>

<p>"Well, when these articles appear—"</p>

<p>"I send them packing, <i>c'est entendu</i>. I never go back on
my word," Naniescu said, with a grandiose gesture.</p>

<p>"It would not pay you to do that in this case, my friend. Lady
Tarkington has your written promise and she would raise hell if you
played her false. But I wasn't thinking of that. I only wished to
warn you to keep an eye on those two young firebrands."</p>

<p>"Oh," Naniescu retorted, with a shrug, "once I have them out of
the country they can do what they like. They no longer hurt me.
Especially after the publication of those beautiful articles."</p>

<p>"That is so, but you are sending Count and Countess Imrey out of
the country aren't you?"</p>

<p>"What makes you say that?"</p>

<p>"Well, you paid Blakeney for the articles with the title-deeds
of Kis-Imre, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"How did you know that?"</p>

<p>"I didn't," Number Ten replied drily. "I guessed, and you gave
yourself away."</p>

<p>"Well, and if I did—what is it to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, my friend. Nothing. I come back to my original
warning. Keep a close eye on young Imrey and Anna Heves, and above
all keep a close eye on Blakeney."</p>

<p>"That young blackguard?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that young blackguard! He may be playing a double game,
you know. I suppose he is still in Cluj?"</p>

<p>"I thought of that," Naniescu broke in curtly, "so I have had
Imrey and the Heves girl transferred to Sót."</p>

<p>"Sót? Isn't that rather near the frontier?"</p>

<p>"Thirty kilometres."</p>

<p>"But why Sót?"</p>

<p>"We have commandeered a château there, which we use as a prison
for political offenders. We chose it because it stands alone in an
out-of-the-way part of the country, and it saves the nuisance of
public manifestations and disturbances when a prisoner who happens
to have been popular is condemned. We try them by a military
tribunal which holds it sittings at Sót, and if an execution is
imperative—well, it is done without any fuss."</p>

<p>"I see. Well," Number Ten went on, as he rose to take his leave,
"I need not detain you any longer. Let me assure you," he
concluded, with his habitual sardonic smile, "that I shall not now
think of interfering with any of the measures which you have
adopted to stop Lady Tarkington from running after her
manuscript."</p>

<p>"I don't believe that you could have interfered in any case,"
Naniescu retorted gruffly.</p>

<p>"It is not too late, my friend. I would rather like to pit my
wits against yours. So if you have repented of the bargain—"
And Number Ten half drew his bulging pocket-book out of his
pocket.</p>

<p>"Oh, go to the devil!" Naniescu exclaimed, half in rage and half
in laughter.</p>

<p>"And I hope soon to meet you in his company," Number Ten
replied, and he finally took his leave from the two men.</p>

<p>As soon as the door had closed on him, Naniescu turned and
looked at his friend. But de Kervoisin had picked up his book, and
gave him no encouragement to discuss the intriguing personality of
Number Ten.</p>

<p>His face, too, was quite inscrutable. Marcel Proust was engaging
his full attention. For a moment it seemed as if Naniescu would
fall back on his stock phrase, or else on a string of cosmopolitan
oaths; he even drew his breath ready for either; then it seemed as
if words failed him.</p>

<p>The intriguing personality was above comment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 38</h2>

<p>Rosemary had never before welcomed her husband so eagerly as she
did that afternoon. As soon as she heard the whirring of his motor
she ran to the gates to meet him.</p>

<p>"What news?" she cried when he had brought the car to a
standstill.</p>

<p>As usual, his dark eyes flashed with joy when he saw her. He
jumped down and raised both her hands to his lips.</p>

<p>"Very vague, I am afraid," he replied. "And some of it a mere
conjecture."</p>

<p>"Tell me."</p>

<p>"To begin with, young Imrey and Anna Heves have been transferred
to Sót."</p>

<p>"Where is that?"</p>

<p>"Between Cluj and the frontier. It seems that there is a château
there that is being used as a prison for political offenders."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?"</p>

<p>"Naniescu. I saw him for a moment. He was very busily engaged
with the Minister for Home Affairs who was over from Bucharest, so
he could only give me a few minutes."</p>

<p>"Had he seen Elza?"</p>

<p>"No. But she had applied for permission to see Philip and Anna,
and he gave the permission. He supposed that she had gone on to Sót
by train."</p>

<p>"Even so," Rosemary mused, "she would be back by now, or else
she would have wired."</p>

<p>Jasper appeared to hesitate for a moment or two, and then he
said: "I don't think that she has been allowed to do either."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It is mere surmise, my dear," Jasper went on quietly, "but one
thing Naniescu did tell me and that was that he had on behalf of
his government definitely made over the Kis-Imre estates to Peter
Blakeney."</p>

<p>They were walking round the house towards the veranda when he
said this. Rosemary made no response; indeed, it might be thought
that she had not heard, for the next question which she put to
Jasper appeared irrelevant.</p>

<p>"Does the midnight express stop at Sót?"</p>

<p>"It does," Jasper replied.</p>

<p>"Then, I can see Elza there. I am sure that is where she is. You
inquired at Ujlak?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Elza went there first and then to Cluj."</p>

<p>They had reached the veranda now, and Rosemary went up the steps
and then into the house.</p>

<p>"You still wish to come with me to-night?" she asked her husband
before she went upstairs.</p>

<p>"Why, of course."</p>

<p>"You are not too tired after all this running about?"</p>

<p>"I?" he exclaimed with a laugh. "Tired? When it is a question of
being near you!"</p>

<p>He tried to capture her wrist, but she evaded him and ran
quickly through the hall and up the stairs. Before going into her
room she called down to him:</p>

<p>"If we use your motor we need not start before eleven o'clock,
and there is still a chance of Elza being home before then."</p>

<p>It was just before dinner that the culminating tragedy occurred.
Rosemary was in her room, when she heard loud commotion coming form
the hall—harsh, peremptory voices, a word or two from Anton,
and then Jasper's voice raised as if in protest. She opened her
door, and to her horror saw a squad of soldiers in the hall, and
between them an officer, and a man in civilian clothes who had an
official-looking paper in his hand, and was apparently explaining
something to Jasper.</p>

<p>"I regret, my lord, but these are my orders," the man was
saying, "and I cannot enter into any discussion with you."</p>

<p>Jasper tried to protest again. "But surely—" he began. The
man, however, cut him short.</p>

<p>"If you like," he said, "I can allow you to see Count Imrey
first, but this order I must deliver into his own hands."</p>

<p>Rosemary in the meanwhile had run downstairs.</p>

<p>"What is it, Jasper?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p>"An order of eviction," Jasper replied curtly, "against that
wretched Maurus."</p>

<p>"Whatever does that mean?"</p>

<p>"That he must quit this place within twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" she exclaimed hotly.</p>

<p>She turned to the officer and the civilian who had brought this
monstrous order.</p>

<p>"The whole thing is a mistake," she said coolly; "some error in
the name. Count Imrey is a loyal subject of the King. There has
never been a hint of disloyalty levelled against him."</p>

<p>The officer in charge gave a curt laugh and shrugged his
shoulders, and the civilian said with a sneer:</p>

<p>"They all say that, milady. They are all wonderfully loyal after
they have been found out."</p>

<p>"But General Naniescu himself is a friend of the family. And
Lord Tarkington and I can vouch—"</p>

<p>"Pardon, milady," the civilian broke in coldly. "This affair
does not concern you or Lord Tarkington, and the order of eviction
is signed on behalf of the present owner of Kis-Imre by His
Excellency the Governor himself."</p>

<p>"On behalf—"</p>

<p>It was Rosemary who spoke, but the sound of her voice might have
come out of a grave. She had never been so near to swooning in her
life. The walls around her, the woodwork, the stairs, all took on
distorted shapes, and moved, round and round and up and down, until
everything was a blur through which the faces of the Roumanian
officer and the civilian stared at her and grinned. "On behalf of
the present owner of Kis-Imre!" But that was Peter! Peter! And the
world did not totter, the earth did not quake, and engulf all these
monstrous crimes, this cruelty and this shame!</p>

<p>Luckily none of the Roumanians appeared to have noticed this
sudden weakness in her; the civilian was consulting with the
officer whether he should allow milord Tarkington to break the
awful news to Maurus. Neither raised any objection, and Jasper
pronounced himself ready to go. Rosemary turned appealingly to
him:</p>

<p>"You will be very patient, Jasper," she begged, "and very, very
gentle?"</p>

<p>"Leave it to me, dear," he responded; "I'll do my best."</p>

<p>When he was gone, Rosemary mechanically asked the officer and
his companion to come into the smoking-room and sit down. She
offered cigarettes. They made her ceremonious bows, and were as
polite and conventional as circumstances demanded. She tried to
talk; she even asked questions; but they were diplomatically
ignorant of everything except of their duty. They explained that
this consisted in seeing Count Imrey personally, and giving the
eviction order into his own hands.</p>

<p>"It will kill him," Rosemary said, with conviction, "or else
send him out of his mind."</p>

<p>Both the men shrugged. They had seen so much of this sort of
thing, one of them said, people always threatened to die or to go
mad, but nothing of the sort had ever happened.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure of that?" Rosemary retorted.</p>

<p>Somehow the episode had brought back into the forefront of her
consciousness her responsibility with regard to her newspaper
articles. Not that conscience had been dormant, but Peter's infamy
had been such an overwhelming shock that every other emotion had
slipped away into the background. But now it all came back to her.
Those articles of hers if they were published would bring a
justification of all this—of these orders of eviction, the
sort of thing that men died of, or went mad over out of grief,
while officials shrugged their shoulders, having seen it all so
often.</p>

<p>A few minutes after Jasper returned and Maurus was with him. At
sight of Maurus, Rosemary had risen from her chair as if drawn up
by mechanical force, and she remained standing, staring at the man
whom she had last seen as a fragile weakling, babbling incoherent
words. Maurus had dressed himself with unusual care. It almost
seemed as if he had been expecting visitors. Rosemary had never
seen him with hair so sleekly brushed, or chin so smooth. The
officer and the civilian had risen to greet him, and he went up to
them with perfect calm, inquiring politely what they desired to say
to him. Rosemary turned a questioning glance on Jasper. He, too,
appeared puzzled, and followed Maurus' every movement as if he
dreaded that something would happen presently, and all the man's
self-possession disintegrate in a tempest of fury.</p>

<p>But nothing of the sort happened. Maurus took the order from the
civilian, and read it through carefully. Not a muscle of his face
twitched, and his hands were perfectly steady. For the moment
Rosemary wondered whether this outward calm was not some form of
madness.</p>

<p>"I can't understand it," she whispered to Jasper, while the
three men were engaged together.</p>

<p>"I am just as puzzled as you are," Jasper replied.</p>

<p>"So long as he is not just putting a terrible strain on
himself—in which case the reaction will be frightful."</p>

<p>Maurus was now taking leave of the officials.</p>

<p>"I quite understand the position," he said quietly. "If I had
bought a house, I, too, would wish to take possession of it as soon
as possible. Perhaps," he added, with a smile, "I should not have
been quite in such a hurry, but we all know that with the English
time is money, eh, messieurs? And now all I need do is to thank you
for your courtesy. I will comply with the order, chiefly because I
have no choice."</p>

<p>It was almost unbelievable. Rosemary thought that her eyes and
ears must be playing her a trick. The two Roumanians took their
leave with their habitual elaborate politeness and Maurus himself
saw them to his front door, where the squad of soldiers still stood
at attention. When they had all gone, he came back into the
smoking-room, and he was actually laughing when he entered.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such swine?" he said lightly, and then
apologized to Rosemary for his language.</p>

<p>"You are taking it so bravely, Maurus, dear," Rosemary murmured
bewildered. "But what about Elza?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she prepared me for it; she knew all about it yesterday,
and she sent me word what to bring along in the way of clothes for
her. And, of course, there will be her jewellery, and one or two
little things to see to. However, I have got twenty-four hours
before me, and there will be Anton and Rosa to help me."</p>

<p>"But, Maurus, dear—"</p>

<p>"You are astonished, dear Lady Tarkington," Maurus broke in,
with rather a sad smile, "to see me take it all so calmly. I was
born in this house, and I always thought that I would die in it;
but lately these walls have seen so much sorrow and so many
villainies that I would just as soon turn my back on them."</p>

<p>"But what does Elza feel about it?"</p>

<p>"The same as I do. She writes quite calmly."</p>

<p>"When did you hear from her?"</p>

<p>"Early this afternoon—so you see I was prepared."</p>

<p>"But where is she?" Rosemary asked insistently.</p>

<p>"She was at Sót when she wrote to me. She had seen Philip and
Anna. And she was on the point of leaving for Hódmezö. This was
late last night. She is in Hungary by now—and in safety.
Please God I shall be with her soon."</p>

<p>He still spoke quite quietly, in short, crisp sentences, with
nothing of the rambling and babbling about his speech that had been
so pathetic to witness yesterday. But though Rosemary ought to have
felt reassured and comforted about him, she could not rid herself
of a persistent feeling of dread: the same sort of feeling that
invades the nerves at the manifestation of a supernatural
phenomenon. There was nothing supernatural about Maurus certainly,
but his attitude was so abnormal, so unlike himself, that Rosemary
caught herself watching with ever-increasing anxiety for the moment
when his real, violent nature would reassert itself.</p>

<p>A moment or two later the dinner-bell rang, and Maurus was full
of apologies.</p>

<p>"My stupid affairs have prevented your getting on with your
packing, dear Lady Tarkington. Can you forgive me?"</p>

<p>Rosemary could only assure him that all her packing was done.
"And anyway," she added, "as Jasper has a car we need not start
before eleven o'clock."</p>

<p>"Ah, then," Maurus said, and offered her his arm to lead her
into the dining-room, "we need not hurry over dinner; and I shall
have the pleasure of two or three more hours of your company."</p>

<p>Jasper all the while had been strangely silent. Rosemary could
see that he was just as much puzzled as she was, and that he was
studying Maurus very keenly while the latter was talking. During
dinner and while the servants were about, the conversation drifted
to indifferent subject. This was the first time that Maurus had a
meal in the dining-room since he was taken ill four days ago, and
he was like a child enjoying his food and delighted with
everything. It was only when coffee had been brought in and the
servants had gone away that he reverted to the important subject of
his departure.</p>

<p>"My chief cause of regret, dear Lady Tarkington," he said, "is
that I cannot welcome you here when you return from your journey.
But perhaps we could meet at Budapest, not? Elza speaks about that
in her letter to me. She is very anxious to see you."</p>

<p>"I shall break my journey at Hódmezö," Rosemary said, "and
probably wait there twenty-four hours till you come."</p>

<p>She had it in her mind that she could wire from there to The
Times office, and in any case she had to see Elza.</p>

<p>"There are two good hotels in Hódmezö," Maurus rejoined. "Elza
is staying at the Bristol. A very grand name for a simple
provincial hotel, but it is very comfortable, I believe. Peter
Blakeney's cricket people stayed there last week, you know."</p>

<p>He even could mention Peter's name calmly; and a quaint old
English saying came to Rosemary's mind, ever her professional
activities brought her in contact with extraordinary people.
"Nought so queer as folk!" She almost said it aloud; for never in
all her life had she witnessed anything so strange as this
metamorphosis of a violent-tempered, morbid epileptic into a calm,
sensible man of the world, who takes things as he finds them, and
Fate's heaviest blows without wearing his heart on his sleeve.</p>

<p>"I shall not forget the Bristol at Hódmezö," she said after a
little while, "and I will certainly remain with Elza until you
come. Perhaps I can help her to endure the suspense."</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"How did the letter get to you? Through the post?"</p>

<p>"No; she sent a peasant over from Sót, a lad who lives in
Kis-Imre and was returning home. You know him, dear Lady
Tarkington—him and his brother—the two sons of János
the miller."</p>

<p>"Those two brave lads who—"</p>

<p>Rosemary paused abruptly. The last thing she wanted to do was to
bring back to Maurus' memory that fateful night of the children's
abortive escape; but Maurus himself broke in quietly:</p>

<p>"Yes, the two fellows who helped us all they could that night
when Philip and Anna tried to get out of the country. The attempt
was unsuccessful, as you know. Philip and Anna were captured. They
are in Sót now. But the two sons of János—I forget their
names—got over the frontier safely. They joined the
cricketers at Hódmezö, and are safely back at the mill now."</p>

<p>"Thank God," Rosemary exclaimed fervently, "they did not suffer
for their devotion."</p>

<p>"No, I am glad of that," Maurus concluded, with obvious
indifference. "But the authorities don't trouble about the
peasants. It is the landed aristocracy and the professional classes
who have to suffer, if they belong to the conquered race."</p>

<p>It was past ten o'clock before the small party broke up. During
the latter part of the time it had been Rosemary's turn to become
silent. Maurus started the subject of politics, and Jasper carried
on a desultory argument with him on that inexhaustible question. In
almost weird contrast to his previous calmness, Maurus' violent
temper broke out once or twice during the course of the discussion,
and it needed all Jasper's tact and Rosemary's soothing influence
to steer clear of all that tended to aggravate him. It was the real
man peeping through the armour of all the previous unnatural
self-control, the gipsy blood reasserting itself—self-willed,
obstinate, impatient of control, bitter against humiliation.
Rosemary almost welcomed the change when it came. It was more like
the Maurus she knew—a man eccentric and violent, walking
close to but not over-stepping the borderland that separates the
sane from the insane. It was only when Philip, or Elza, or Kis-Imre
were mentioned that he seemed to step over that borderland, encased
in an armour of impish indifference.</p>

<p>The soldier-chauffeur brought the car round at eleven o'clock.
Rosemary took affectionate leave of Maurus.</p>

<p>"We meet very soon," she said. "In Hungary."</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied. "In Hungary. I shall be so thankful to be
there."</p>

<p>He also shook hands very cordially with Jasper.</p>

<p>"I am afraid this has not been a very agreeable stay for you,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Better luck next time," Jasper responded, as he settled himself
down in the car beside his wife.</p>

<p>The car swung out of the gates. Rosemary, looking back, had a
last vision of Maurus standing under the electric lamp in the
porch, his hand waving a last farewell.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 39</h2>

<p>Rosemary must have fallen asleep in the corner of the carriage,
for she woke with a start. The train had come to a halt, as it had
done at two or three stations since Cluj was left behind. So it was
not the sudden jerk, or the sound of the exhaust from the engine,
that had caused Rosemary suddenly to sit up straight, wide awake
and with that vague feeling of apprehension which comes on waking
when sleep has been unconsciousness rather than rest. Jasper sat in
the other corner with his eyes closed, but Rosemary did not think
that he was asleep. They had a sleeping compartment, but hadn't had
the beds made up; it was perhaps less restful for the night
journey, but distinctly cleaner. The carriage was in semi-darkness,
only a feeble ray of blue light filtered through the shade that
tempered the gas-light up above.</p>

<p>Rosemary pulled up the blind. They were at a small station dimly
lighted by one oil-lamp above the exit door. A clump of acacia
trees in full leaf effectually hid the name of the station from
view. A couple of soldiers stood at the door through which a number
of peasants, men with bundles and women with baskets, one or two
Jews in long gabardines and a prosperous-looking farmer in town
clothes and top-boots were filing out. Someone blew a tin-trumpet,
a couple more soldiers stalked up the line in the direction of the
engine. There was a good deal of shouting.</p>

<p>Rosemary drew the blind down again, and tried to settle herself
comfortably in her corner once more. But sleep would not come. She
looked at her watch. It was past two. This seemed an unconscionably
long halt, even for a train in this part of the world. Rosemary
peeped again behind the blind. The station appeared quite deserted
now except for the two soldiers on guard at the door. Everything
seemed very still—of that peculiar stillness which always
seems so deep when a train comes to a halt during the night away
form a busy station, and all the more deep by contrast with the
previous ceaseless rumbling of the wheels. From the direction of
the engine there came the sound of two men talking. Otherwise
nothing.</p>

<p>Rosemary reckoned that they should be over the frontier soon,
but, of course, if they were going to have these interminable
halts—</p>

<p>Half an hour went by. Even the distant hum of conversation had
ceased, and the silence was absolute. Feeling unaccountably
agitated rather than nervous, Rosemary called to Jasper. At once he
opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"What is it, my dear?" he asked vaguely. "Where are we?" And he
added, with a shake of his long, lean body: "These carriages are
deuced uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"We are at a small station, Jasper," Rosemary said. "And we've
been over half an hour. Have you been asleep?"</p>

<p>"I remember this confounded train pulling up. I must have
dropped off to sleep after that. I wonder where we are."</p>

<p>"We can't be very far from the frontier. I thought at first they
would turn us out for the customs, or passports or something. But
nothing has happened, and we don't seem to be getting on. I do hope
there has not been a breakdown on the line."</p>

<p>"My dear!" Jasper exclaimed, rather impatiently, "why in the
world should you think that there is a breakdown on the line?
There's a signal against us, I suppose. That's all."</p>

<p>But Rosemary was not satisfied. "Do you mind," she said, "seeing
if you can get hold of anybody. I can't help feeling nervous
and—"</p>

<p>At once Jasper was on his feet, courteous, attentive as always.
"Of course I'll go and see, my darling," he said. "But it's not
like you to be nervous."</p>

<p>He drew back the shade so as to get a little light into the
carriage, straightened his clothes, then went out into the
corridor. Everything was so still that Rosemary could hear his
footstep treading the well-worn strip of carpet, then the opening
of the carriage door, which sent a welcome draught of air through
the stuffy compartment. Rosemary pulled up the blind, and leaned
out the window. It was pitch-dark, though the sky was starry. The
small oil-lamp still flickered over the exit door, and the two
soldiers were still there. Rosemary saw Jasper's vague silhouette
in the gloom. He stood for a moment looking up and down the line;
then he walked away in the direction of the engine. A few minutes
went by, and presently Rosemary saw Jasper coming back, accompanied
by the guard.</p>

<p>"What is it, Jasper?" she called. "Where are we, and what has
happened?"</p>

<p>The two men had come to a halt immediately beneath her window.
The guard doffed his cap at sight of her, and scratched his head in
obvious perplexity.</p>

<p>"We are at Sót, my darling, but I have bad news for you, I am
afraid," Jasper said. "There has been a very serious landslide
lower down the line. I suppose it is due to the heavy storms.
Anyway, the line is blocked for a distance of nearly half a
kilometre, and of course there will be considerable delay. I don't
understand all the man says, but it seems to have been a terrible
catastrophe."</p>

<p>But out of all this only two words had penetrated Rosemary's
brain—"considerable delay." What did that mean? She asked the
guard, but he only shook his head. He didn't know. He didn't know
anything except that there had been a landslide, and that no train
could get through till the line was clear. He supposed that a gang
would come down in the morning, but he couldn't say. Rosemary
wanted to know whether there would be any other way of continuing
the journey and picking up a train the other side of the frontier.
The guard again shook his head. He really couldn't say; he was a
stranger to these parts, but perhaps in the morning—He
suggested respectfully that the gracious lady should allow him to
make up a couple of beds in two of the sleeping compartments. There
was no one else on the train, so—</p>

<p>"No one else on the train?" Rosemary broke in curtly. "What does
he mean, Jasper? There must be other passengers on the train. Where
have they gone to?"</p>

<p>Jasper put the question to the guard.</p>

<p>"The last of the passengers got out at this station, gracious
lady. When it was known that the line was blocked this side of the
frontier, no one took a ticket further than Sót."</p>

<p>"How do you mean? When was it known that the line was
blocked?"</p>

<p>"Before we left Cluj, gracious lady, and so—"</p>

<p>"But they sold us tickets to Budapest, and said nothing about a
breakdown," Rosemary exclaimed. And then she turned to her husband:
"Jasper, tell me, is this man a fool or a liar, or am I
half-witted? You took our tickets to Budapest. Did the man at the
ticket-office say anything to you about a block on the line?"</p>

<p>"No," Jasper replied, "he did not."</p>

<p>"But our luggage?"</p>

<p>"We have no registered luggage—only what we have with us
in the carriage."</p>

<p>"Of course, how stupid of me! But when the man clipped your
ticket?"</p>

<p>"He didn't say anything."</p>

<p>Rosemary, impatient, her nerves on edge, turned again to the
guard. "You saw the gracious gentleman's tickets," she said, "when
we got into the train. Why didn't you warn us?"</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps the gracious lady and gentleman would only go
as far as Sót and sleep there. I thought everyone knew about the
landslide, and that every passenger had been warned."</p>

<p>"Can we get a car here that will take us to Hódmezö?"</p>

<p>"Not at this hour, gracious lady."</p>

<p>"Or a vehicle of any sort?"</p>

<p>The guard shook his head. Rosemary could have screamed with
impatience until Jasper's quiet voice broke in: "I think, my dear,
that by far the best thing to do will be to let the man make up a
couple of beds for us, and to try and possess ourselves in patience
until the morning. There is nothing to be done—really,
darling, nothing. And, after all, it may only mean a delay of eight
to ten hours."</p>

<p>Then, as Rosemary remained silent, making no further objection,
he slipped some money into the guard's hand, and told him to get
the beds ready. After that he re-entered the carriage, and rather
diffidently sat down beside his wife.</p>

<p>"I feel terribly guilty, dear one," he said humbly, "but you
know I don't speak Roumanian very well, and when these sort of
people jabber away, I don't always understand what they say. And I
was rather anxious about you at Cluj. You seemed so agitated, so
unlike yourself."</p>

<p>"Can you wonder? Twenty-four hours' delay may mean that
Naniescu's courier will get to London and make arrangements before
I have time to wire. I must see Elza first, and in the
meanwhile—"</p>

<p>"My darling," Jasper put in, with a quick, wearied sigh, "it is
not like you to be so illogical. Do you really suppose that events
move at such a rate in a newspaper office? There is bound to be
delay—and there's ample time for your telegram to reach The
Times before the editor has even thought of inserting your
articles. Even if we are held up here for twenty-four hours, you
can see Elza and send your wire from Hódmezö before Peter Blakeney,
or whoever Naniescu's courier happens to be, can possibly have made
any arrangements with The Times ."</p>

<p>"Of course, dear, of course," Rosemary said, more calmly. "I am
stupid to-night. This whole business has got on my nerves, I
suppose. I don't seem to know what I am doing."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 40</h2>

<p>On the narrow made-up bed, with the coarse linen and the heavy
blanket, and the smell of sulphur and dust about her, Rosemary
found it quite impossible to get any rest. At first there had been
a good deal of clumsy shunting, the engine probably had been
detached, the tin-trumpet sounded at intervals, and there was a
good deal of shouting; but all these noises ceased presently, and
the night seemed peculiarly still. Still, but not restful. Rosemary
could not sleep. Fortunately the communicating doors between her
compartment and the one which Jasper occupied were closed, so she
felt free to fidget, to get up or to lie down as the mood seized
her, to turn on the light to read or to meditate, without fear of
disturbing him.</p>

<p>She could not help feeling desperately nervous. Jasper, of
course, was quite right: there was plenty of time in which to see
Elza, and then to send a telegram to London if necessary, so there
was nothing in a few hours' delay to worry about. Nevertheless she,
who had always prided herself on independence and level-headedness,
felt a strange kind of foreboding—something vague and
indefinite that nevertheless was terrifying. She tried to compose
herself and could not. She forced herself into quietude,
deliberately kept her eyes closed and her body still. It was
torture, but she did it because she wanted to feel that she still
controlled her nerves, and that she was not giving way to this
stupid sense of fear.</p>

<p>And there was no denying it; the fear that beset her was on
account of her coming interview with Elza. Maurus' attitude had
been very strange, even abnormal, and it was consequent on a letter
from Elza. And Rosemary, though she had not owned it to herself
before, felt a growing conviction that Elza's lofty patriotism had
given way at last to mother-love. Confronted with Philip and Anna,
who no doubt had youth's passionate desire to live, with Anna's
mother who was all for conciliating the tyrants, and with Maurus
whose reason was threatening to give way, Elza had laid down her
arms, had capitulated and decided that her son's life must be saved
at any cost. Perhaps she knew that Rosemary's articles had fallen
into Naniescu's hands, perhaps she and Peter had actually been in
collusion over the theft, perhaps—perhaps—There was no
end to conjecture, and no limit to Rosemary's dread of what the
next four-and-twenty hours would bring.</p>

<p>Only now did she realize what it had meant to her to place the
final decision into Elza's hands. With it she had given her
professional honour, her very conscience into another woman's
keeping. She had probably only done it because she was so sure of
Elza, of Elza's patriotism and her sense of justice and honour.
Poor Elza! Who could blame her for being weak, for being a mother
rather than a patriot? She should never have been placed before
such a cruel alternative. Self-reproach, the stirrings of
conscience helped to aggravate Rosemary's racking anxiety. She got
up in the early dawn, made what sketchy toilet the limited
accommodation allowed, and went out into the open. The little
station appeared quite deserted; only the two soldiers were still
there on duty at the exit door. Rosemary marvelled if they were the
same two who had been there during the night. They looked perfectly
stolid, unwashed and slouchy in their faded, coarse-looking
uniforms and dusty boots and <i>képis</i>.</p>

<p>Rosemary looked up and down the line. The train, consisting of
half a dozen coaches, looked derelict without its engine, and there
was no guard in sight. She had no eyes for the beautiful scenery
around—the narrow valley bordered by densely wooded heights;
the mountain-side covered with oak and beech that were just
beginning to clothe themselves in gold and at the approach of
autumn; the turbulent little mountain-stream; the small station
nestling amidst gnarled acacia trees; and on the right the quaint
Transylvanian village with the hemp-thatched roofs and bunches of
golden maize drying in the sun, with its primitive stuccoed church
and whitewashed presbytery. Rosemary saw nothing of this; her eyes
searched the landscape for the château—now a prison for
political offenders—where Philip and Anna were
detained—those children whose safety would be paid for
perhaps by countless miseries, by worse tyranny and more cruel
oppression. But there was no large building in sight, and presently
Rosemary caught sight of Jasper, some way up the line, walking
toward her in the company with a man in very négligé toilet, who
probably was the station-master.</p>

<p>At sight of Rosemary, Jasper hastened to meet her, while the man
kept at a respectful distance.</p>

<p>"What news?" Rosemary cried eagerly.</p>

<p>Jasper appeared dejected. "Not very good I am afraid," he said.
"The station-master here tells me that he has been advised that the
line will take the whole of the day to clear—probably
more."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," Rosemary said resolutely, "we must get a
car."</p>

<p>"Impossible, my dear; you can't get across if the road is
blocked."</p>

<p>"All the roads in Transylvania are not blocked, I imagine,"
Rosemary retorted drily. Then she called to the station-master: "I
want," she said, "to get to Hódmezö to-day. Can I get a car
anywhere in Sót?"</p>

<p>"But the roads are impassable, gracious lady," the man
exclaimed; "the landslide—"</p>

<p>"Never mind about the landslide. There are other roads in
Transylvania besides this one. I can go by a roundabout way, but I
can get there somehow if I have a car. Or," she added impatiently,
seeing that the man was looking very dubious, "a conveyance of any
sort, I don't care what it is."</p>

<p>"Alas! gracious lady, that is just the trouble. The soldiers
were here yesterday, and they commandeered all the horses and
bullocks in Sót for military purposes. It is so hard," the man went
on, muttering half to himself; "no sooner does a man scrape
together a little money and buy an old horse, then the soldiers
come down and take it away from him."</p>

<p>The man was full of apologies and explanations, but somehow
Rosemary had the impression that he lied. He rambled on for a while
in the same strain; Rosemary did not hear him. Her brain was at
work trying to find a way to combat this net of intrigue that was
hemming her in. She was quite sure that the man was
lying—that Naniescu had ordered these ignorant yokels to tell
the lies that suited him. She, Rosemary, Lady Tarkington, a British
subject, could not be held up at the frontier, of course, but there
could be a landslide, a block on the line, no conveyance available,
horses commandeered by the military, two, three, perhaps four days'
delay while Naniescu's courier was speeding to London with
Rosemary's manuscript and her letter to the editor of The Times
asking for early publication.</p>

<p>She turned with some impatience to Jasper.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?"</p>

<p>Gravely he shook his head.</p>

<p>"Accept the inevitable," he replied gently. "I understand that
there is quite a clean little hotel in the place, and twenty-four
hours' delay is not very serious, is it?"</p>

<p>"It would not be," she admitted, "if it were not prolonged."</p>

<p>"It can't be prolonged indefinitely."</p>

<p>"No," she retorted, "for I can always walk to the frontier."</p>

<p>"Over mountain passes?" he queried, with a smile.</p>

<p>But she only gave a scornful shrug. "Accept the inevitable?" How
little he knew her. The more she saw difficulties ahead, the more
she felt ready for a fight. Time was still in her favour. Hódmezö
was not far with its telegraph service, and Naniescu's power did
not extend beyond the frontier.</p>

<p>Always supposing that Elza did wish her to wire.</p>

<p>Rosemary thought tings over for a moment or two; then she said
to Jasper: "Very well! I'll possess myself in patience for
twenty-four hours. Will you see about rooms at the hotel? And I
suppose this man will see about our luggage being taken
across?"</p>

<p>"Of course I'll see to everything, dear," Jasper said meekly.
"But you would like some breakfast, wouldn't you?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 41</h2>

<p>Meekly and obediently Jasper went off to see after the luggage,
and Rosemary wandered away as far as the village. Her first
thoughts as far as the village. Her first thought was to ascertain
definitely whether indeed there was no chance of hiring some sort
of conveyance to take her as far as Hódmezö. The first man she
spoke to was the keeper of the inevitable grocery store. He had
heard a rumour that there was a block on the railway line somewhere
near the frontier, and this annoyed him very much because he was
expecting a consignment of maize from Hungary, and he supposed that
he would not now get it for two or three days. He had no horse.
Hadn't had one since the beginning of the war, when his nag was
commandeered. Now even an old crock was so dear it did not pay to
buy.</p>

<p>Rosemary asked him if he knew of anyone in the village from whom
she could hire a horse and cart to take her as far as the frontier,
but the man shook his head. The Jew at the hotel had two horses,
and the priest had one, but the military were down from the
barracks yesterday and took those away. There were maneuvers in
progress somewhere, it seems. The soldiers said they would bring
the horses back in two or three days, but it was very hard and
inconvenient for everybody when that sort of thing was done.</p>

<p>Rosemary asked, what about oxen? But draft-oxen and some
buffaloes belonging to the mayor had also been commandeered. It was
very hard. Did not the gracious lady think so?</p>

<p>Finally the storekeeper made a suggestion that with the help of
a little baksheesh the gracious lady might succeed in getting the
officer at the château to let her have what she wanted. The château
was only a couple of kilometres from the village. It lay close to
the road; the gracious lady couldn't fail to spy the great iron
gates. It had belonged at one time to Count Fekete, but the family
had been gone some time, and the château was now a cavalry barrack,
and some prisoners of war were still kept there.</p>

<p>The storekeeper offered his son as an escort to the gracious
lady, so that she should not miss her way. But Rosemary declined
the offer; she purchased a few stale biscuits from the man,
intending to ask for a glass of milk from some cottage on the way;
then she set out at a brisk pace down the road. It ran along the
mountain-side, and some fifty feet below the turbulent little
stream tossed and tumbled over stones and boulders, its incessant
murmuring making a soothing accompaniment to Rosemary's thoughts.
At the last cottage in the village, where Rosemary had obtained a
glass of fresh milk from a comely peasant woman, the latter had
directed her to a mountain path which ran below the road, parallel
with it, and close to the edge of the stream. Here it was perfectly
lovely; the moist, sweet air, the occasional call of birds, the
beech and oak and dense undergrowth, the carpet of moss, the
occasional clearing where the grass was a luscious green, and the
mauve campanula grew to a stately height. At times the path rose
sharply, twenty feet or more above the stream; at others it ran
level with the water's edge; and at one place the stream widened
into a little bay, where the water was as clear as a fairy pool and
of a translucent blue.</p>

<p>Rosemary lingered for a little while beside the pool, thinking
how delicious it would be to bathe in it. When she went on again
she came to a sharp bend in the path, and as soon as she had
rounded this she saw some twenty yards farther on a man dressed in
the uniform of a Roumanian officer, sitting upon a tree stump close
by the water's edge. The man sat with his elbows resting on his
knees, and his head was buried in his hands. He looked like a man
in trouble. Rosemary walked on, a dry twig crackled under her
tread, and the man suddenly looked up.</p>

<p>It was Peter.</p>

<p>The moment he caught sight of Rosemary he jumped up, and then
made a movement as if he meant to run away. But Rosemary, with
sudden impulse, called to him at once:</p>

<p>"Don't go, Peter."</p>

<p>It seemed as if the magic of her voice rooted him to the spot.
He stood quite still, but with his back to her; and then he took
off his <i>képi</i> with one hand, and passed the other once or
twice across his forehead.</p>

<p>Rosemary felt strangely disturbed and puzzled. Why was Peter
here? How did he come to be here? And in this uniform?</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to speak to me, Peter?" she asked, because
Peter being here seemed so amazing that for the moment she thought
that she was seeing a vision; "or even look at me?" she added.</p>

<p>"I did not suppose you particularly wished me to speak to you,"
he said, without turning round to face her.</p>

<p>"Why should you say that?" she asked simply.</p>

<p>"Because I imagine that you look upon me as such an unmitigated
blackguard that the very sight of me must be hateful to you."</p>

<p>She said nothing for a moment or two. Perhaps she was still
wondering if he was real, and if so, how he came to be
here—just to-day and at this hour. Then she went deliberately
up to him, put her hand on his arm, and forced him to look at
her.</p>

<p>"It is true, then?" she asked, and her eyes, those pixie eyes of
hers, luminous and searching, were fastened on his as if seeking to
penetrate to the very soul within him. But a look of dull and
dogged obstinacy was all that she got in response.</p>

<p>"It is all true, Peter?" she insisted, trying with all her might
to steady her voice, so that he should not hear the catch in her
throat.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, indifferent and still obstinate.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," he retorted, almost roughly.</p>

<p>"I mean," she said slowly, "that these last few days have not
just been a hideous nightmare, as I still hoped until—until
two minutes ago. That things have really happened—that
you—that you—"</p>

<p>She paused, physically unable to continue. It was all too vile,
too hideous to put into words. Peter gave a harsh laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't spare me," he said, with a flippant laugh. "You mean
that you did not believe until two minutes ago that I was really a
spy in the pay of the Roumanian Government, and that you did not
believe that I had intrigued to have Philip and Anna arrested,
stolen your articles for The Times, and bought Kis-Imre over Aunt
Elza's head, and turned her and Maurus out of their home. Well, you
believe it now, don't you? So that's that. And as I am on my way to
meet a friend, you'll excuse me, won't you, if I run away? Is there
anything else I can do for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "You can look me straight in the eyes and tell
me what has brought you down to—to this. Is it money?"</p>

<p>Peter shrugged. "The want of it, I suppose," he replied.</p>

<p>"I have no right to ask, I know. Only—only—we were
friends once, Peter," she went on, with a note of pleading in her
tone. "You used to tell me all your plans—your ambitions. You
used to say that you did not want to—to bind me to a promise
until you had made a name for yourself. If you had told me that you
were short of money, and that you were actually thinking of taking
up this—this sort of work, I could have helped you. I know I
could have helped you. I know I should have found the right words
to dissuade you. Oh, Peter!" she went on almost wildly, unable to
hold her tears longer in check, or to control the tremor in her
voice, "it is all so horrible! Can't you see? Can't you see? We
were such friends! You used to tell me everything. You were taking
up your father's work. Some of your scientific experiments were
already attracting attention. And you were a sportsman, too! And
your V.C. And now this—this! Oh, it is too horrible—too
horrible!"</p>

<p>Her words were carrying her away. The murmur of the water grew
louder and louder in her ears, and in the trees the soughing of the
wind among the leaves grew almost deafening. She felt herself
swaying, and for a few seconds she closed her eyes. But when she
put out her hand she felt it resting on Peter's arm. There was the
feel of the rough cloth of his tunic. So she opened her eyes and
raised them slowly until they met his. Her glance had wandered on
the ugly uniform, the livery of his unspeakable shame. Her eyes
expressed the contempt which she felt, the loathing which was
almost physical. But Peter's glance now was not only dogged, but
defiant. In it she read the determination to follow in the path of
life which he had chosen for himself, and a challenge to her power
to drag him away from it. This was no longer the Peter of Kis-Imre,
the irresponsible young English athlete, whose thoughts would never
soar above the interest in a cricket-match. It was more the Peter
of olden times—the tempestuous lover, the wayward creature of
caprice, the temperamental enthusiast capable of heroic deeds, and
always chafing under the restraint imposed by twentieth-century
conventions; the Peter whose soul had once been equally great in
virtue as it was now steeped in crime; the gallant soldier, the
worthy descendant of the Scarlet Pimpernel. It was the Peter of
olden times, but his love for her was dead. Dead. If one spark of
it had remained alive, if something of her image had remained in
his heart, he could never have given himself over to this vile,
vile thing. But while she had been battling bravely to banish from
her mind all memories of their early love, he had torn her out of
his heart, and turned to this ignominious calling to help him to
forget.</p>

<p>Rosemary felt giddy and ill; even the sweet woodland air seemed
to have turned to poisonous fumes of intrigue and venality. She
roughly pushed away from Peter's arm that supported her, but she
was still swaying; her hat fell from her head, and her glorious
hair lay in a tumbled mass of ruddy gold around her face.</p>

<p>"Better sit down on this old stump," Peter remarked drily.
"You'll have to lean on me till you get to it."</p>

<p>But Rosemary did not really know what happened just
then—she had such a gnawing pain in her heart. She certainly
tottered forward a step or two until she reached the tree-stump,
and she sank down on it, helped thereto, no doubt, by Peter's arm.
The next thing of which she was conscious was a flood of tears that
would not be checked. It welled up to her eyes, and eased that
heavy pain in her heart. Great sobs shook her bowed shoulders, and
she buried her face in her hands, for she was ashamed of her tears.
Ashamed that she cared so much.</p>

<p>And the next thing that struck her consciousness was that Peter
sank down on his knees before her, that he raised her skirt to his
lips, and that he murmured: "Good-bye, sweetheart. My Rosemary for
remembrance. God bless and keep you. Try to forget." Then he jumped
to his feet and was gone. Gone! She called him back with a cry of
despair: "Peter!" But he was nowhere to be seen. He must have
scrambled up the incline that led to the road. She certainly heard
high above her the crackling of dry twigs, but nothing more. Peter
had passed out of her life, more completely, more effectually,
indeed, than on the day when she became Jasper Tarkington's wife.
Peter—her Peter, the friend of her girlhood, the master from
whom she had learned her first lesson of love, was dead. The thing
that remained was a vague speck, a creation of this venal post-war
world. It was as well that he should go out of her life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 42</h2>

<p>A minute or two later Rosemary was startled out of her day-dream
by the sound of Jasper's voice calling to her from somewhere in the
near distance. She had barely time to obliterate the traces of
tears from her eyes and cheeks before he appeared round the bend of
the path. The next moment he was by her side. Apparently he had
been running, for he seemed breathless and not quite so trim and
neat in his appearance as he usually was.</p>

<p>"I heard a scream," were the first words he said, as soon as he
came in sight of her. "It terrified me when I recognized your
voice. Thank God you are safe!"</p>

<p>He was obviously exhausted and, for him, strangely agitated. He
threw himself down on the carpet of moss at her feet; then he
seized her hand and covered it with kisses. "Thank God!" he kept on
murmuring. "Thank God you are safe!"</p>

<p>Then suddenly he looked up at her with an inquiring frown. "But
what made you scream?" he asked.</p>

<p>Rosemary by now had regained control over her nerves. She
succeeded in disengaging her hand, and in smiling quite coolly down
upon him.</p>

<p>"It was very stupid of me," she said, with a light laugh. "I saw
a pair of eyes looking at me through the undergrowth. It startled
me. I thought that it was a wild cat—I had heard that there
were some in these parts—but it was only a homely one."</p>

<p>She tried to rise, but Jasper had recaptured her hand. He was
engaged in kissing her finger-tips one by one, lingering over each
kiss as if to savour its sweetness in full. Now he looked up at her
with a glance of hungering passion. Rosemary felt herself flushing.
She was conscious of an intense feeling of pity for this man who
had lavished on her all the love of which he was capable, and
hungered for that which she was not able to give. He looked
careworn, she thought, and weary.</p>

<p>"You were not anxious about me, Jasper, were you?" she asked
kindly.</p>

<p>He smiled. "I am always anxious," he said "when I don't see
you."</p>

<p>"But how did you find me?"</p>

<p>"Quite easily; I went to the hotel, you know. Not at all a bad
little place, by the way; rather primitive, but with electric light
and plenty of hot water. In engaged the rooms, and had a mouthful
of breakfast. Then I sallied forth in quest of you. A man in the
village told me you had been asking the way to the château, and I
knew you would never stand the dusty road. So when I found that
there was a woodland path that went through the same way as the
road, I naturally concluded that you would choose it in preference.
You see," Jasper concluded, with a smile, "that there was no magic
in my quest."</p>

<p>Then he looked up at her again, and there was a gleam of
suspicion in his dark, questioning eyes. "You must have walked very
slowly," he said. "I started quite half an hour, probably more,
after you did."</p>

<p>"I did walk very slowly. This path is enchanting, and this is
not the first time I have sat down to think and to gaze at this
delicious little stream. But," Rosemary went on briskly, "I think I
had better be getting on."</p>

<p>But Jasper putout his arms and encircled her knees. "Don't go
for a minute, little one. It is so peaceful here, and somehow I
have had so little of you these last days. I don't know, but it
seems as if we had taken to misunderstanding one another lately."
Then, as she made an involuntary movement of impatience, he
continued gently: "Do I annoy you by making love to you?"</p>

<p>Rosemary tried to smile. "Of course not, dear. What a
question!"</p>

<p>"Then tell me if there is anything in the world I can do to make
you happier. You have not looked happy lately. I have been tortured
with remorse, for I feel somehow that it has been my fault."</p>

<p>"You are sweet and kind, Jasper, as always. But you must be a
little patient. I have gone through a great deal these last few
days."</p>

<p>"I know, I know, little one. Don't let us talk any more about
it."</p>

<p>He was wonderfully kind—kinder and gentler than he had
been since the first days of their married life. It almost seemed
as if he had set himself the task of making her forget all that he
had involuntarily revealed to her of his violent, unbridled
temperament, and of that lawless passion that lay at the root of
his love for her.</p>

<p>He talked of the future, of their return to England, the home
that he would make for her, which would be a fitting casket for the
priceless jewel which he possessed. Rosemary, who felt
inexpressibly lonely, was once more conscious of that feeling of
gratitude towards him which she had once hoped might be transmuted,
in days to come, into something more ardent than friendship.</p>

<p>She had suffered so terribly in her love for the one man who,
with all his faults, had come very near to her ideals, that she
felt a desperate longing to cherish and to cling to the husband
whom she had chosen half out of pique, the man on whom she had
inflicted so much cruelty by becoming his wife.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 43</h2>

<p>Rosemary was the first to remember that time was slipping by.
She looked at her watch. It was past ten o'clock—over an hour
since Peter had asked her to try to forget. She rose briskly to her
feet, and arm in arm, like two good comrades, she and Jasper made
their way together towards the château. When they came in sight of
the great gates—a couple of hundred yards still ahead of
them—Rosemary was the first to spy a motor-car standing
there, and some half-dozen persons in the act of getting into the
car. There were two sentries at the gates, and seemingly a few
people on the other side.</p>

<p>"It looks like a man and a woman and three soldiers in uniform
getting into that car," Rosemary remarked casually. And
immediately, for no apparent reason, Jasper started to walk along
more rapidly; a few seconds later he almost broke into a run. At
that moment the car started off, and was soon lost to sight in a
cloud of dust. Rosemary thought that she heard Jasper utter a
savage oath.</p>

<p>"Is anything wrong?" she asked. But he did not answer, only
hurried along so quickly that she was not able to keep up with him.
He had passed through the gates when she reached them, and when she
tried to follow she was stopped by the sentry. She called to
Jasper, who apparently did not hear; pointing to him, she explained
to the man on duty that she was that gentleman's wife, and if he
was allowed to go in, why not she? They were as mute as if she had
spoken in an unknown tongue, but they would not allow her to pass.
In the meanwhile Jasper had disappeared inside the château.
Rosemary had seen him go in by the main entrance, challenged by the
sentry on guard at the door, but after a second or two allowed to
pass freely in.</p>

<p>Fortunately she was provided with money, and her experience of
this part of the world was that most things could be accomplished
with the aid of baksheesh. A young officer was crossing the
courtyard; he looked in the direction of the gates, saw an
excessively pretty woman standing there, and, true to his race and
upbringing, came at once to see if he could enter into conversation
with her. Very politely he explained to her that no one was allowed
to enter the château, or to visit any of the prisoners, without a
special permit from the commanding officer.</p>

<p>Rosemary told him that she desired to speak with the commanding
officer. This also, it seems, was impossible. But a hint from
Rosemary as to reward if the matter could be managed simplified
matters a great deal.</p>

<p>The young officer conducted her across the courtyard and into
the château. It had been a fine place once, not unlike Kis-Imre in
architecture, but its occupation by the military had stripped it of
every charm. There were not carpets on the floors, and only very
rough furniture in the way of chairs and tables in what had
obviously been at one time a cosy lounge hall. The officer led the
way through a couple of equally bare rooms en enfilade, and came to
a halt outside a door which bore roughly chalked upon the finely
carved and decorated panels the legend: "Major Buriecha. Private.
No admittance." He offered one of the rough chairs rather
shamefacedly to Rosemary, and said: "Major Buriecha will becoming
through here presently. Will you wait, gracious lady? You will be
sure to see him. I am afraid," the young man added, with a pleasant
smile, "that it is the best I can do."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you announce me?" Rosemary asked. "I am Lady
Tarkington. I am sure Major Buriecha would not refuse to see
me."</p>

<p>The officer's smile became self-deprecating. "It is more that I
should dare to do, milady," he said. "The major is engaged in
conversation with an important government official. I would even
ask you kindly, when you see him, not to tell him that I brought
you as far as here."</p>

<p>"I couldn't do that, even if I wished, as I don't know your
name."</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Uriesu, at your service, milady."</p>

<p>"I suppose," Rosemary went on, after a moment's hesitation, "you
couldn't tell me what has become of my husband, Lord Tarkington. He
went through the gates and entered the château, then I lost sight
of him. But he seemed to be well known inside this place. Could you
find out for me where he is?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid not, milady," the young officer replied politely.
"I have not the honour of Lord Tarkington's acquaintance."</p>

<p>He stood at attention, waiting for a moment or two to see if the
English lady had any further questions she wished to ask; then as
she remained silent, he saluted gravely and went out of the room,
leaving Rosemary to bear her soul in patience, and to wonder what
in the world had become of Jasper.</p>

<p>At first only a confused murmur of voices came to her ears
through the closed doors of Major Buriecha's private room. But
gradually one of those voices grew louder and louder, as if raised
in anger; and Rosemary, astonished, recognized that it was Jasper
speaking—in French, and obviously with authority—to
Major Buriecha, the officer commanding!...What in the
world—?</p>

<p>She heard some words quite distinctly:</p>

<p>"You are a fool, Buriecha! No one but a fool could have been
taken in like this."</p>

<p>And the voice that gave reply was humble, apologetic, decidedly
tremulous with fear. Rosemary could not distinguish what it
said.</p>

<p>Major Buriecha engaged in conversation with Jasper! And Jasper
reprimanding him with obvious authority! What could it mean? At
first she had only been puzzled, now a vague sense of uneasiness
stirred in her heart. Uneasiness that almost partook of fear. With
sudden impulse she rose and went to the door. Orders or no orders,
she must know what was going on inside that room. Her hand was on
the latch when she paused, listening. Was it mean to listen?
Perhaps; but instinct was stronger than good conduct, and she had
just heard Jasper's harsh voice giving a curt command:</p>

<p>"Get through to General Naniescu at once," and then the click of
the telephone receiver being lifted from its hook and the whir of
the bell-handle. What could she do but listen? There was silence
inside the private room now, but Rosemary could hear Jasper's
easily recognizable step pacing restlessly up and down. And one
moment he paused quite close to the door, and Rosemary quickly drew
back a step or two, ready to face him if he came. But he resumed
his pacing and she her watch by the door. Presently she heard the
other voice—the major's, presumably—saying: "Is that
you, Marghilo? Ask his Excellency the Governor to come to the
telephone, will you?" There was a pause, then Buriecha spoke again:
"Tell him it is Major Buriecha. And, I say, Marghilo, tell him it
is very important and desperately urgent."</p>

<p>Again there was a pause, a long one this time. Jasper was still
pacing up and down the room. Rosemary could picture him to herself,
with his habitual stoop and his thin hands held behind his back.
Once he laughed, his usual harsh, mirthless laugh. "You'll get a
fine dressing-down for this, my friend. I am thinking," he said.
"Naniescu won't make light of it, I can tell you."</p>

<p>Silence once again. Then Jasper's voice speaking into the
telephone, and always in French: "Hallo! Hallo! Is that you,
Naniescu? good! Number Ten speaking."</p>

<p>Number Ten! What—? But there was no time to think, no time
for puzzlement or fear. Jasper was speaking again.</p>

<p>"Buriecha has bade a complete fool of himself. He has allowed
young Imrey and the girl Heves to escape! Hallo! Did you hear me?
It's no use swearing like that, you'll only break the telephone.
Yes, they've gone, and you've got to get them back. Went by car
half an hour ago, in the direction of Cluj, but probably making for
the frontier—what? Oh, a plot, of course, engineered by that
damned Blakeney. No use cursing Buriecha; you are as much to blame
as he is. Eh? Of course, for treating with that young devil behind
my back! Yes, you—Well, hold on and listen. Blakeney, I am
sure it was he, came here with a forged order from you, demanding
that Imrey and the girl shall be delivered to him for transference
to an unknown destination. Eh? Well, of course he should have
known, but he says your signature looked perfect; he thought it was
all in order. The rascal was in officer's uniform, and had two men
with him also in uniform. What can you do? Telephone all along the
roads to your frontier police, of course. If they stick to the car
they are bound to be stopped. Yes, five persons—three of the
men in uniform, in an open car. The prisoners have probably taken
on some disguise by now. Shoot at sight, of course, if the car does
not slow down. Police the mountain paths as well. Blakeney can't
know them well. I don't know who the other two men are. Hungarian,
perhaps, or English. Don't delay. Yes, yes! What's that? Marghilo
getting through? Good! Well, that's the best you can do. We'll have
a reckoning presently, my friend. You should not have treated with
him, I say. He has probably robbed your courier of the newspaper
articles or else telegraphed in Uno's name to The Times not to
print them, and then got the prisoners out of your clutches by this
impudent trick. Oh, all right. Hurry up! You have no time to waste,
nor have I. Yes! All right. Come along if you want to. I shall be
at Sót all right enough. But you won't enjoy the interview, my
friend, I promise you that. What?"</p>

<p>Jasper had ceased speaking for some time, but Rosemary still
stood beside the door—a woman turned to stone. Her hands and
feet were numb. She could not move; only from time to time a cold
shudder travelled down her spine. She felt nothing, not even
horror. It was all too stupendous even for horror. A cataclysm, a
ball of fire, a flame that froze, ice that scorched. A
topsy-turvydom that meant the kingdom of death.</p>

<p>And Jasper, her husband, was on the other side of that door,
Jasper Tarkington, her husband! The spy of an alien government,
Number Ten! A thing! A rag torn and filthy. The man whose name she
bore. She could hear his footstep in the next room, his mirthless
laugh, his harsh voice muttering curses or else invectives against
the other man, who was only a fool. Then suddenly the footsteps
came to a halt. The door was pulled open and Rosemary stood face to
face with Jasper.</p>

<p>At sight of her he stood stock-still. An ashen hue spread over
his face. The curse that had risen to his throat died before it
reached his lips.</p>

<p>From the room behind him Major Buriecha's tremulous voice was
asking if anything was amiss. Jasper closed the door and stood with
his back to it, still facing Rosemary. His eyes, always hawk-like
and closely set, had narrowed till they were mere slits, and his
lips had curled up over his jaws, showing his teeth white and
sharp, like those of a wolf. An expression of intense cruelty
distorted his face. He was about to speak, but Rosemary put up her
hand to stop him.</p>

<p>"Not here," she commanded. "Not now."</p>

<p>He gave a hard laugh and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It had to come some time, I suppose," he said coolly. "I am not
sorry."</p>

<p>"Nor I," she replied. "But will you please go now? We'll meet
later—in the hotel."</p>

<p>He looked her up and down with that glance which she had learned
to dread, and for a moment it seemed as if he would yield to that
ungovernable passion in him and seize her in his arms. Rosemary did
not move. Her luminous eyes, abnormally dilated, never left his
face for one instant. She watched the struggle in the man's
tortuous soul, the passion turned to hatred now that he stood
revealed. She did not flinch, because she was not afraid. The man
was too vile to inspire fear.</p>

<p>"Go!" she said coldly.</p>

<p>For another second he hesitated, but it was the banal sound of
Buriecha spluttering and coughing on the other side of the door
that clinched his resolve. This was neither the place nor the time
to assert his will, to punish her for the humiliation which he was
enduring. Once more he laughed and shrugged his shoulders, then he
walked slowly out of the room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 44</h2>

<p>For over half an hour Rosemary waited in that bare, cheerless
room, and gazed unseeing out of the window while she tried vainly
to co-ordinate her thoughts. In the forefront of her mind there was
a feeling of great joy which she hardly dared to analyse. Joy! And
she also had the feeling, though she had come to the very brink of
an awful precipice, though she was looking down into an abyss of
shame and horror, with no hope of ever being able to bridge the
chasm over, that yet on the other side was peace—peace that
she would never attain, but which was there nevertheless, to dwell
on, to dream of, when the turmoil was past and she be allowed to
rest.</p>

<p>After about half an hour the young officer who had first
conducted her to the fateful spot came back to see what had
happened. He seemed astonished that she was still there.</p>

<p>"Major Buriecha has not yet come out of his room," Rosemary
managed to say quite coolly. "It is getting near dinner-time. I
don't think I'll wait any longer."</p>

<p>The young man appeared relieved. Anyway he was not likely now to
get into trouble on the English lady's account. He clicked his
heels together, expressed perfunctory regret at her disappointment,
the offered to conduct milady out of the château. Rosemary accepted
his escort and took leave of him at the gates.</p>

<p>"If milady, will write to the commanding officer," Lieutenant
Uriesu said at the end, "I am sure he will give the permit milady
requires."</p>

<p>"I will certainly take your advice," Rosemary assented
cheerfully. "Good-bye, Lieutenant Uriesu, and thank you for your
kind efforts on my behalf."</p>

<p>She walked back towards the village by way of the path. When she
came to the spot where first she had seen Peter that morning, she
sat down on the tree-stump and listened to the murmur of the
stream. She would not allow herself to think of Peter—only of
Philip and Anna, whom he was taking across the frontier by another
clever trick—in disguise, probably—and over the
mountain passes. Rosemary could not believe that they would stick
to the car and be stopped by the frontier police. They would get
away into Hungary—on foot. They were young, they knew the country,
and they could scramble over the mountain passes and be at Hódmezö
soon, where Elza would be waiting for them. Elza knew, of course,
and Maurus knew too. That was why he had been so calm and so
composed when he was told that he must leave Kis-Imre within
four-and-twenty hours. The all knew. Peter had trusted them. Only
she, Rosemary, had been kept out of his councils, because she might
have betrayed them to Jasper, and Peter could not tell her that it
was Jasper who was the miserable spy.</p>

<p>But no, she would not think of Peter, or of how he had worked to
circumvent Jasper at every turn. She only wanted to think of Philip
and Anna, those two children who were so ingenuously learning the
lesson of love one from the other, and of Elza, so patient and so
heroic, and of Maurus, who had played his part so well. Maurus
would be coming through from Cluj some time to-day, and he, too,
would be held up at Sót, and perhaps spend the night in the funny
little hotel. Rosemary hoped that she would see him. His company
would be very welcome whilst Jasper was still there. Then to-morrow
she and Maurus would get across the frontier somehow, and join up
with Elza and the children at Hódmezö. And there was always the
British Consul in Cluj to appeal to. There was no desperate hurry
now. The children were safe and those articles of hers would not be
published in The Times. Peter would have seen to that.</p>

<p>But no, she did not want to think of Peter. Was she not still
Jasper Tarkington's wife?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 45</h2>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when Rosemary at last made her way
back to the small hotel in Sót. She had spent the day roaming about
the forests, and eating such scrappy food as she could purchase at
one or other of the cottages. Twice she had been to the railway
station to meet the trains that were due in from Cluj. She hoped
that Maurus might have come by one of them. Now there was not
another due before the midnight express, which got to Sót in the
small hours of the morning. The farce of there being a block on the
line was still kept up. Passengers got out of the train, grumbling,
and the small hotel was full to capacity. It was a low, irregular
building, with a very large courtyard closed on three sides, and a
wide archway, through which cars and carriages could drive in,
intersecting the fourth. One side of the house was given over to
stabling and cowsheds, another to kitchens and offices, the other
two held the guest-rooms and one or two public rooms. Some of the
bedrooms were level with the ground, and on the floor above a
wooden gallery ran right round the courtyard. The courtyard itself
seemed to be the principal meeting-place for cows and chickens, and
even pigs, which roamed freely about the place and entered any door
that happened to be conveniently open. The best bedrooms gave on
the balcony above. On inquiry Rosemary was informed that the
English milord had booked three rooms that morning for himself and
milady who would be coming during the day. A buxom, bare-footed
peasant girl then conducted milady up to these rooms.</p>

<p>Rosemary went along heavy-footed. She was more tired than she
would have cared to admit. She had had very little food all day,
and her nerves by now were terribly on edge. It had been a day
packed full of emotion and there was more to come. There was the
inevitable interview with Jasper. Horrible as it would be, she had
no intention of shirking it. She would leave him, of course, with
the hope never to set eyes on him again, but certain matters would
have to be arranged between them, and Rosemary's moral courage
would not allow her to have recourse to letter-writing or to the
help of lawyers. She knew what she wished to say to Jasper, and
would have despised herself if she had shrunk from the ordeal.</p>

<p>The hours went slowly by. Later in the evening she ordered some
supper to be brought up to her room. She found it difficult to
swallow any food, but she drank two cups of deliciously strong
coffee, and munched some of the excellent and very sustaining maize
bread for which this part of the country is famous. She had a book
in her suit-case and contrived to read for a while, but she could
not concentrate on what she was reading, and soon had to put the
book away. Time hung very heavily. She was terribly weary and yet
she could not sleep. And she could not understand what had become
of Jasper. She had seen or heard nothing of him since they parted
in that ugly, bare room, the picture of which would for ever remain
graven in her mind as the place where she had experienced the
greatest horror in her life. No one in the hotel had seen him. A
vague sense of uneasiness began to stir within her. At the same
time she dismissed from her mind any fear for his safety. She was
quite sure that whatever he ultimately decided to do, he would not
pass out of her life without a final struggle for mastery. She did
not dread the interview. She knew it to be inevitable; but she
longed passionately for it to be over—to know the
worst—to feel certain of that measure of freedom for which
she meant to fight.</p>

<p>And because she longed for the interview to be over she would
not go to bed before Jasper returned. She sat in the narrow
slip-room, grandiosely described by the hotel proprietor as the
salon, which divided Jasper's room from hers. The one window, which
was wide open, gave her a beautiful view over the mountains, and
the evening sky studded with stars. Somewhere the other side of
those mountain-tops Philip and Anna were speeding towards
freedom—the freedom which Peter had won for them by dint of
courage, resource and wit. Instinctively, memory recalled that
other weary waiting at Kis-Imre, when she and Elza had watched and
prayed together through the hours of the night. And torturing fears
rose out of the darkness lest this second attempt at flight should
prove as unsuccessful as the first.</p>

<p>It was past midnight when Rosemary heard Jasper's familiar step
along the wooden balcony. He came straight to the door of the salon
and entered, apparently without the slightest hesitation. He closed
the door behind him, and throwing down his hat said coolly:</p>

<p>"I saw the light under the door, so I knew you had not gone to
bed yet. I've been in some time, but stayed to have some supper in
the coffee-room. Very good supper, too. They know how to cook in
Hungary. That is the one thing the Roumanians might with advantage
learn from them."</p>

<p>He threw himself into a chair and drew his cigarette-case out of
his pocket. Having selected one he offered his case to
Rosemary.</p>

<p>"Have one?" he asked. When she shook her head he shrugged and
laughed, then he struck a match and lighted his cigarette. His hand
was perfectly steady. The flame of the match brought for a moment
into relief his narrow hatchet face, with the dark eyes set closely
together and the harsh Wellingtonian features. Rosemary looked at
him curiously. It was the first time she had really studied his
face closely since she knew. Once or twice, before she had been
repelled by a flash of animal passion in his eyes, and once she had
caught sight of his face in the mirror in the smoking room at
Kis-Imre, when it was distorted by a wolfish expression of cruelty.
Now both the passion and the cruelty were there, expressed around
his mouth and in his eyes which looked at her over the tiny
flickering flame.</p>

<p>Deliberately he blew the match out, took a long whiff from his
cigarette, and said calmly:</p>

<p>"How you are going to hate me after this!"</p>

<p>After a second's pause he added: "Well, I have had so much
cruelty to endure from you in the past, a little more or less won't
make much difference."</p>

<p>"I have never meant to be cruel, Jasper," Rosemary rejoined
coldly. "But I know now that the cruelest thing I ever did to you
was to become your wife."</p>

<p>"You only found that out, my dear, since you saw Peter Blakeney
again."</p>

<p>To this Rosemary made no answer. She shrugged her shoulders and
turned her head away. Jasper jumped up and gripped her by the arm,
making her wince with pain.</p>

<p>"Before we go any further, Rosemary," he said with a savage
oath, "I'll have it out with you. Are you still in love with Peter
Blakeney?"</p>

<p>"I refuse to answer," Rosemary said calmly. "You have no longer
the right to ask me such a question."</p>

<p>"No longer the right," he retorted with a harsh laugh. "You are
still my wife, my dear. What happened this afternoon will not give
you your freedom in law, remember."</p>

<p>"I know that, Jasper. What happened this afternoon has broken my
life, but, as you say, it cannot give me my freedom, save with your
consent."</p>

<p>He gave a derisive chuckle. "And you are reckoning on that, are
you?" he asked drily.</p>

<p>"I am reckoning on it."</p>

<p>"Then all I can say, my dear, is that, for a clever woman, your
calculations are singularly futile."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," she rejoined. "I know enough about the laws
of England to know that they do not compel me to live under your
roof."</p>

<p>"You mean that you intend to leave me?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"And create a scandal?"</p>

<p>"There need be no scandal. We'll agree to live apart; that is
all."</p>

<p>"That is not all, my dear," he retorted drily, "as you will find
out to your cost."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that Peter Blakeney chose to follow you to Transylvania;
any number of witnesses can testify to that. I mean, that we are
now in a country where money will purchase everything, even such
testimony as will enable Lord Tarkington to divorce his wife, and
raise such a hell of scandal around Mr. Blakeney that no decent
club would have him as a member, and he would have to live out of
England for the benefit of his health."</p>

<p>Rosemary had listened to him without attempting to interrupt.
She even tried hard not to reveal the indignation which she felt.
When he had finished speaking, and once more threw himself into a
chair, with a sigh of self-satisfaction, she said quite
quietly:</p>

<p>"I thought that this afternoon I had probed the lowest depths to
which a man's nature could sink. But, God help me! I have seen
worse now!"</p>

<p>"That is as it may be, my dear. A man fights for what he
treasures with any weapon that comes to his hand."</p>

<p>"For what he treasures, yes! But you—"</p>

<p>"I treasure you beyond all things on earth," he broke in
hoarsely. "You are my wife, my property, my own possession. You may
love Blakeney and hate me, but I have rights over you that all the
sophistries in the world cannot deny me. I am alone," he went
on—and in one second he was on his feet again, and before she
had time to defend herself he had her in his arms—"I alone
have the right to hold you as I am holding you now. I alone have
the right to demand a kiss. Kiss me, Rosemary, my beautiful,
exquisite wife, with the pixie eyes! Though you hate me, kiss
me—though you love him, kiss me—Mine is still the
better part."</p>

<p>He pressed his lips against hers, and for these few horrible
moments Rosemary, half swooning, could only lie rigid in his arms.
But horror and loathing gave her strength. With her two hands she
pushed against him with all her might. "Let me go," she murmured.
"I hate you."</p>

<p>But he only laughed. "Of course you hate me. Well, I like your
hatred better than the cool indifference I have had from you up to
now. You hate me, my dear, because you don't understand. With all
your vaunted cleverness you don't understand. Women such as
you—good women, I suppose we must call them—never would
understand all that there is in a man that is evil and vicious and
cruel. Yes, in every man! Deep down in our souls we are
blackguards, every one of us! Some of us are what women have made
us, others have vices ingrained in our souls at birth. Have you
ever seen a schoolboy tease a cat, or a lad set a terrier against a
stoat? Would you hate him for that? Not you! If he has revolted you
too much, you may punish him, but even so you'll only smile: it is
boy's nature, you will say. Well, boy's nature is man's nature.
Cruel, vicious! Civilization has laid a veneer over us. Some of us
appear gentle and kind and good. Gentle? Yes! On the surface. Deep
down in our souls, grown men as we are, we would still love to
tease the cat, or to see a terrier worry a stoat. Whilst men had
slaves they thrashed them. Where wives are submissive their
husbands beat them. Give a man power to torture and he will do it.
Boy's nature, I tell you, but we dare not show it. We are gentlemen
now, not men. And most of us have a false idea that women would
despise us if they knew. And so we smirk and toady and pretend, and
those of use who are not puppets writhe against this pretence. I
was born a savage. When I was a schoolboy I was not content with
teasing a cat, I loved to torture it; if a horse was restive I
would thrash it with the greatest joy. Later I reveled in twisting
a smaller boy's wrist until he screamed, in pulling a girl's hair
or pinching her arm—anything that hurt. Boy's nature. Most
women only smiled! Then came the war and the world was plunged in
an orgy of cruelty. I was a very fine linguist and became attached
to the secret service. I worked for the French army. I no longer
pulled girl's hair nor pinched their arms, but I—the
spy—tracked enemy spies down—women and
men—dragged them out of their lair as a terrier would a
stoat, and brought them before the military tribunals to be
condemned and shot. But the women still smiled. Good women, mind
you! Those whom I was tracking down were Germans, and so I—the
spy—was a hero and they were only human refuse whom to
torture was a duty. When war was over and my uncle died I inherited
a title, and civilization threw the mantle of convention over me,
imposed on me certain obligations. My work was done. I became a
puppet. I smirked and toadied and tried to pretend. Oh, how I
loathed it! Restrictions, civilization, drove me mad! If I had
never met you I should have gone off to a land where I could keep
slaves and work my will on them, or turned Moslem and kept
numberless wives, whom I could beat when the mood seized me. But I
met you, and all my desires were merged in the one longing to have
you for my own. You were adulated, famous, rich probably. I had a
title to offer you and nothing else. My friend de Kervoisin, who
knew my capabilities, spoke to me of Transylvania, a conquered
country where rebellion was rife. He spoke to me of Naniescu, an
ambitious man, unscrupulous and venal, who wanted help to
consolidate his position, to put himself right before his
government and before the world by brining to light intrigues and
conspiracies that did not always exist. The work meant money. I
took it on. I made over £100,000 in three years, and there was more
to come. Already I was a rich man and the work satisfied the boy's
nature in me. Following up a clue. Disguises. Tracking a man down,
or a woman. Seeing their fear, watching their terror. Arrests,
secret trials. Executions in the early dawn. Scenes of desolation
and farewells. I had them all! They helped me to endure the London
seasons, the evenings at the club, the balls, the crowds, the
futility of it all. And the money which I earned brought me nearer
and nearer to you. Luck was on my side. Peter Blakeney courted you,
and like a fool he lost you. How? I did not know and cared less. I
won you because I was different from other men, because you were
piqued, and because I interested you. Because I knew how to smirk
and toady better than most. Then came the question of Transylvania.
Naniescu entrusted me with the task of discovering the authorship
of certain articles that had appeared in English and American
newspapers which impugned his administration. He offered me ten
thousand pounds if I succeeded in brining the author to justice,
and ten thousand more if certain articles which you were to write
were published in The Times. The very first morning that we were in
Cluj the girl Anna Heves gave away her secret. Once I had her and
Philip under arrest it was easy enough to bring pressure to bear
upon you. I almost succeeded, as you know. At first it was
difficult—whilst Elza and Maurus Imrey were ignorant of the
bargain that Naniescu had proposed to you. I had only gained one
victory, I was not likely to win the other. So, while you thought
me in Bucharest, I came back disguised as a gipsy and warned Elza
that Philip and Anna were in danger of death. This brought
everything to a head. Unfortunately Peter Blakeney already
suspected me. It began probably in England—exactly when I
shall never know—but he was my friend once, and then suddenly
I felt that we had become enemies. I must have given myself away at
one time, I suppose, and he is as sharp as a wild cat. He followed
us to Transylvania—to make sure...Then at Cluj Anna Heves
confided in him. The children's arrest confirmed his suspicions,
and that night at Kis-Imre he recognized me under my disguise as a
gipsy. Curse him! After that the whole adventure became a battle of
wits between him and me. I won the first round when I spied out the
plan for Philip and Anna's escape; I won again when I persuaded you
to place the whole bargain between yourself and Naniescu before
Elza, and indirectly induced you to write the newspaper articles
which he wanted. I thought I had won an easy victory then. But
Peter Blakeney stole your manuscript, and I feared then that I had
lost everything. The death of Philip and Anna Heves would have been
some compensation, it is true, but I wanted that extra ten thousand
pounds more than I did the joy of seeing those two children shot. I
thought that Peter had stolen the manuscript in order to bargain
with it for the lives of his two cousins, but I know better now. He
sold your manuscript to Naniescu for the Kis-Imre property. It will
stand in his name until he can hand it over to the Imrey's again.
In the meanwhile by a clever ruse he has got Philip and Anna out of
the country. And by now he will have sent a telegram in your name
to The Times. He has won the battle hands down. I am beaten in all,
except in one thing, I have you. Not all his cleverness—and
he is as clever as a monkey, it seems—can take you away from
me. If you leave me, you do so knowing the consequences. Remember
what I said: we are in a country where money can purchase
everything, even such testimony as will enable me to divorce you
and to raise such a hell of scandal around Peter Blakeney that no
decent man in England would shake him by the hand. So now you know.
I have told you my history, and I have extolled Peter Blakeney's
virtues—his heroism, if you like to call it so. And I have
done it deliberately so that you may admire him, regret him, love
him if you must, even whilst you feel yourself irrevocably bound to
me. You are just as much my slave now, as if I had bought you in
the open market. If you continue to hate me, I shall probably hate
you too in the end. But that would not help to free you. On the
contrary, I think it would rather amuse me. I was never content to
tease a cat, I invariably tortured it."</p>

<p>Jasper Tarkington had been speaking without interruption for
nearly ten minutes, but he had not spoken without a pause. He was
pacing up and down the narrow room with his hands held behind his
back, but now and again he had come to a halt, quite close to
Rosemary, either to emphasize a point, or to look her up and down
with a glance of cruelty or merely mockery. Rosemary withstood
every glance without flinching. She was standing close to the table
with her hand resting on it, to giver herself support. She did not
interrupt him. She wanted to hear everything he had to say, right
to the end. When he renewed his threat that he would call false
witnesses in order to create deadly scandal around Peter, and
warned her that she was as much his slave as if he had bought her
in the open market, she had, quite instinctively, glanced down on
the tray which contained the remnants of her supper. There was a
knife on the tray; one with a broad blade narrowing into a sharp
point. She shuddered and turned her eyes away, but Jasper had
caught her glance. He had just finished speaking, and he went
deliberately up to the table, picked the knife up by its point, and
with a mocking smile held it with its handle towards her.</p>

<p>"Very dramatic," he said lightly. "Did you ever see La
Tosca?"</p>

<p>When she made no reply he laughed and threw the knife back on
the table. Then he sat down and lit another cigarette.</p>

<p>There was silence in the little room now. Rosemary had scarcely
moved. The horror and indignation which she had felt at first when
Jasper embarked upon the history of his life had given place to a
kind of moral numbness. She had ceased to feel. Her body seemed
turned to stone; even her soul no longer rebelled. She was this
man's wife, and he had warned her of the means which he would adopt
to bind her, unresisting, to him. Nothing but death could loosen
the bonds which he had tightened by his threats against Peter.</p>

<p>Jasper smoked on in silence. Only the fussy ticking of the
old-fashioned little clock broke the stillness that had descended
like a pall over this lonely corner of God's earth. A little while
ago Rosemary had been vaguely conscious of a certain amount of
bustle and animation in the house, and subconsciously she had
associated this bustle with the probable arrival of guests who had
come off the night train. But that had been some time ago. How long
she did not know; probably before Jasper had begun speaking. She
looked at her watch. It was half-past two. Jasper jumped to his
feet.</p>

<p>"It must be very late," he said coolly. "I really must beg your
pardon for having kept you up so long. Reminiscences are apt to run
away with one."</p>

<p>He put down his cigarette, deliberately went up to his wife and
took her by the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Kiss me, Rosemary," he said quietly.</p>

<p>It seemed to amuse him that she did not respond, for he gave a
mocking chuckle and put his arms round her. He pressed his lips
upon her mouth, her eyes, her throat. Then suddenly he let her go
and she almost fell up against the table.</p>

<p>He then walked across to the door of his room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 46</h2>

<p>Jasper Tarkington, on the point of entering his room, had
switched on the light and then paused on the threshold, uttering a
gasp of astonishment.</p>

<p>"Maurus!" he exclaimed, "what in the world are you doing
here?"</p>

<p>Maurus Imrey was sprawling on the horse-hair sofa, apparently
fast asleep. At Jasper's ejaculation he opened his eyes, blinked,
yawned, and stretched his arms.</p>

<p>"Ah! my dear Tarkington," he said in Hungarian. "I thought you
were never coming."</p>

<p>He rose and shook himself like a big, shaggy dog, and passed his
fingers through his tousled hair.</p>

<p>"I must have been fast asleep," he said.</p>

<p>"But what are you doing here, my friend?" Jasper asked,
frowning.</p>

<p>"Waiting for you to do me a little service. It is so late, I
don't really like to ask you. But I should be badly stranded if you
did not help me."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I left Cluj by the midnight express," Maurus explained. "You
know that we have all been turned out of Kis-Imre. And, by the way,
it is Peter Blakeney who has bought the place. Isn't it a scandal?
I never thought he would be such a swine. You know he is a near
relation of my wife's."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" Jasper muttered impatiently. "What about it?"</p>

<p>"Well, simply that those damned officials at Cluj station never
told me that I could only get as far as Sót. So I arrived here with
my luggage and Anton, and, of course, I found this beastly hotel
full. Not a room to be had, my dear fellow. Did you ever hear of
such a thing? In the olden days one would just have taken a man by
the scruff of his neck and thrown him out of any room one happened
to want for oneself. I don't know what it's like with you in
England, but here—"</p>

<p>"Just as bad," Jasper broke in with a curse, "but in heaven's
name get on, man."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I left my big luggage here, and Anton and I went on
to another little tavern I know of in the village. There, as luck
would have it, the proprietor whom I used to know is dead, and the
new man is one of those Bulgarian agriculturists who come over
every year, you know, for the harvesting. Some of these men do
settle down here sometimes, and this man—"</p>

<p>"Well, what about him?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't know a word of Hungarian, my dear fellow, and he
does not seem to understand much Roumanian either. You once told me
that you had been in Bulgaria and that you knew a little of their
beastly language, so I thought—"</p>

<p>"What is it you want me to do?" Jasper broke in impatiently.
"Walk over with you and arrange with the man about your rooms?"</p>

<p>"If you would not mind. Or could you let me sleep on your
sofa?"</p>

<p>Jasper had hesitated at first. It was close on three o'clock,
and he did not relish the idea of turning out again at this hour;
but the suggestion that Maurus should be his room companion for the
night was far more unpleasant.</p>

<p>"Come along, then," he said curtly. "It isn't far, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Five minutes' walk, my dear fellow," Maurus said with obvious
relief, "just the other side of the stream. And Anton shall walk
back with you afterwards."</p>

<p>"I don't want anybody to chaperon me," Jasper retorted
roughly.</p>

<p>He had to go into the salon to fetch his hat. Rosemary was still
standing there leaning against the table for support. She had very
much wanted to see Maurus at one time, but now it did not seem to
matter. Nothing probably would ever matter again. She heard
Jasper's voice saying in a whisper, "You've heard what this fool
wants. I suppose I shall have to go."</p>

<p>She nodded in response. And then Jasper added with mocking
courtesy:</p>

<p>"Good night, Lady Tarkington."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 47</h2>

<p>Anton saw it all, and it was he who broke the news to
Rosemary.</p>

<p>He had been sitting up in the small slip of a room on the ground
floor which had been assigned to him, waiting for his master and
wondering why the gracious count should be so long upstairs at this
hour with the English lord and lady, when he saw the gracious count
and the English milord come along the first floor balcony, he heard
them go downstairs, and saw them go out of the house.</p>

<p>Anton was rather anxious about his master because the gracious
count had been very, very queer the last twenty-four hours.
Sometimes he would be very hilarious; he would laugh and sing and
shout "Hurrah for Peter! Bravo!" and so on; at others he would be
terribly depressed and sit and cry like a child, or else tear about
the place in a passion of fury. He had had a slight fit after the
gracious English lord and lady had gone, and the sisters thought
that probably the control he had put on himself when the Roumanian
soldiers brought the expulsion order had been too much for his
nerves.</p>

<p>So when Anton saw the gracious count go out with the English
lord at this extraordinary hour he could not help but follow him.
Though there was no moon the sky was clear and the darkness of the
night was just beginning to yield to the first touch of dawn. The
two gentlemen walked quite fast, but Anton was able to keep them in
sight. When they came to the little wooden bridge that spans the
stream the English lord was a few steps ahead of the gracious
count. Suddenly, in mid-stream, the count sprang upon milord from
behind, and in a moment had him by the throat. The English lord,
taken entirely by surprise, fought desperately nevertheless. Anton
had uttered a great shout, and ran to the rescue as fast as ever he
could. Through the gloom he could just see the English milord
forced down, with his back nearly doubled over the slender parapet
of the bridge, and the gracious count bending over him and holding
him by the throat. Anton's shout echoed from mountain to mountain,
but all around there was the silence of the night, broken only by
the howling of a dog outside a cottage door.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, before Anton set his foot upon the bridge, the
catastrophe occurred. The parapet suddenly crashed and gave way
under the weight of the two men, and they were hurled into the
stream below. One awful cry rent the stillness of the night. Anton,
half crazy with horror, waded into the stream, the waters of which
at a point near a huge boulder were stained with a streak of
crimson. The English milord in falling had broken his head against
the stone. The gracious count had probably fallen at first on the
top of him, and then rolled over on his back, thus breaking his
fall. Anton dragged them both, single-handed, out of the stream,
first his master, then the English lord. The latter was dead, but
the gracious count was still breathing and moaning softly. Anton
laid him down upon the grass, and made a pillow for him with his
own coat, which he had taken off. Then he ran to the priest's
house, which was quite close, and rang the bell until he made
someone hear. The priest had been quite kind. He roused his
servant, and together—the priest and Anton and the
servant—carried the gracious count into the presbytery. But
the English milord, who was quite dead, they laid upon the bier in
the tiny mortuary chapel which was by the entrance to the
churchyard.</p>

<p>The priest had already sent for the village doctor, who had done
what he could for the gracious count, but of course, he was
ignorant, and, anyhow, Anton was of the opinion that there was
nothing that any man could do. But he had been to the station and
roused the station-master and asked him to telephone to Dr.
Zacharias at Cluj. Anton was just going to run back and see if the
answer had come through. In the meanwhile he had come over to the
hotel to see if he could speak with the gracious lady.</p>

<p>Rosemary had not yet thought of going to bed. For two hours
after Jasper went out with Maurus she had sat, unthinking, by the
open window. Time for her had ceased to be. She had heard the
howling of a dog. At one moment she had heard a shout, and then a
weird and prolonged cry. But these sounds conveyed no meaning to
her brain. Her thinking powers were atrophied.</p>

<p>Then the bare-footed, buxom, very sleepy little maid came to
tell her that Anton, the valet of the gracious count at Kis-Imre,
desired to speak with her at once. She was fully dressed; she sent
for Anton and he told her what he had seen.</p>

<p>Hastily seizing hat and wrap, she went with Anton out of the
house and through the village to the priest's house. The soft,
colourless light of dawn lay over the mountain and valley. On ahead
the turbulent waters of the stream tossed and played around the
projecting boulders, murmuring of the tragedy which had culminated
within their bosom. Nearing the priest's house Rosemary could see
the narrow bridge, with its broken parapet—</p>

<p>The priest met her at the gate. The gracious count, he said, had
not regained consciousness. He still lived, the doctor said, but
life only hung by a thread. Rosemary sat down by Maurus; bedside
and watched that life slowly ebbing away. In the late afternoon Dr.
Zacharias came over from Cluj. He only confirmed what the village
doctor had said. The spine was broken. It was only a question of
hours. He could do nothing, but at Rosemary's earnest
request—or perhaps on the promise of a heavy fee—he
agreed to come again in the morning.</p>

<p>Less than an hour after he left, the dying man rallied a little.
He opened his eyes, and seeing Rosemary, his face was illumined by
a great joy. She bent over him and kissed his forehead. Two tears
rolled slowly down his wan cheeks. He murmured something, and she
bent her ear till it was quite close to his lips.</p>

<p>"He was a monster," he murmured. "I heard everything. I had to
punish him for the evil he did to my wife and the children. And I
have made you free."</p>

<p>At sunset Maurus Count Imrey passed away into the Unknown.</p>

<p>Then only did Rosemary leave his bedside. Accompanied by the
priest, she went to the little mortuary chapel to take a last look
at the man who had done her such an infinity of wrong. Now that his
stormy life was ended, and his hard features were set in lines of
peace, Rosemary felt once more that aching sense of pity for him
which so often before had prompted her to forgive. She was able to
commend his turbulent soul to God without the slightest thought of
hatred or revenge. He had said once that she would never
understand; but the infinite pity in her heart was born of an
infinite understanding. The man who had atoned for his sins by this
tragic death was not wholly responsible for his actions. He was the
victim of his temperament: more sinned against, perhaps, than
sinning. Who knows? If some other woman had captured his fancy she
might have made him happy, found what was strong and fine in him,
and all that was cruel would perhaps have been submerged beneath a
great wave of love.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 48</h2>

<p>Since then, nearly two years! And this was the season of 1924!
Wembley! The Rodeo! Royalties from Italy and Denmark and Roumania!
The Labour Government!</p>

<p>How far, how very far, seemed Transylvania and Sót and the
little mortuary chapel wherein Rosemary had gazed for the last time
on the enigmatic personality which had once been Jasper
Tarkington—her husband.</p>

<p>Even in death he had kept his secret—the secret of the
strange dual identity which she had never been able to reconcile
one with the other, the cruel, wolfish nature so skillfully hidden
beneath the mantle of super-civilization.</p>

<p>Rosemary had not seen Peter since then. After the tragedy at Sót
she had at last succeeded, by dint of bribery, in entering into
direct communication with the British Consulate at Cluj.</p>

<p>Arrangements for the conveying of Lord Tarkington's body to
England took up some considerable time. She only met Elza in
Budapest when she herself was on her way home. Peter had left by
then for an unknown destination. He had conveyed Philip and Anna
over the frontier. They had soon abandoned the car, fearing
pursuit, and in disguise had made their way to the frontier over
the mountains. They were young and strong, the hardships were not
serious, and the dangers reduced to a minimum once they had reached
the lonely mountain passes. It was the planning of the escape that
had been so wonderful. Peter Blakeney, disguised as a Roumanian
officer, and having with him Captain Payson and a young Hungarian
cricketer, both dressed as Roumanian soldiers, had presented a
forged order for the surrender of the two prisoners, Philip Imrey
and Anna Heves. To the officer commanding the <i>depôt</i> the
order appeared in no way suspicious, and he gave up the prisoners
without question. After that the whole thing became just a
delightful adventure, nothing more. But Elza spoke of Peter with
tears in her eyes. They had all of them mistrusted him. Wasn't that
strange? Did Rosemary guess? Elza wanted to know, and Philip and
Anna plied her with questions.</p>

<p>These were sad days for them all. But still Elza was wonderful,
as wonderful as she had ever been. Even Rosemary never actually
found out just how much of the tragedy Elza knew or guessed. Anton
did not tell her, and to their world the death of the two men who
were known to have been friends was just a terrible accident.
Darkness. A broken bridge. Fatality.</p>

<p>Rosemary never told, of course. She wondered if Peter knew. She
waited on in Budapest for some days hoping for news of him. But
none came. Captain Payson heard in an indirect way that Peter was
still in Transylvania, but no reliance could be placed on the truth
of the rumour. It was only when Rosemary was back in England that
she heard definite news of Peter. Elza wrote to say that he was
living in Kis-Imre. "He is administering the property for us," she
went on. "Isn't he wonderful? I am sure he will make something more
of it than poor Maurus was able to do. Of course, they dare not do
anything to him, because he is a British subject, and he tells me
in his last letter that he hopes in a very few years' time, when
justice had been at last meted out to our unfortunate country, to
hand over Kis-Imre to Philip in a better state than it is now. Then
my poor Philip's dream will, I hope, come true. He and Anna have
loved each other ever since they were tiny children. When he has
once more a fine home to offer her they will be married with my
blessing. And all this we shall owe to Peter Blakeney. Can you
wonder, my dear, that we all worship him? When I look at him I seem
to see my dear and beautiful sister gazing at me through his eyes,
and in his smile I see something of hers, because, just like Peter,
she was always ready to laugh, always smiling at the world, always
doing great and kind things under cover of a joke. So Philip and
Anna and I, we bless Peter and for some reason, which perhaps you
can explain better than I, when we think of him we also think of
you."</p>

<p>Since then nearly two years! Rosemary has resumed work. Her
powerful articles in The International Review on the conditions
obtaining in Transylvania under alien occupation have begun at last
to arouse from its apathy public opinion in England and America.
Time and her own perseverance, aided by the lovers of justice and
fairplay who abound in Anglo-Saxon communities, would after a
while, she felt, do the rest. Rosemary had seen the rampant evil
with her own eyes, now she was conscious of her power to help in
remedying, or, at any rate, mitigating it. She threw herself heart
and soul into the work not only because she loved it and because it
thrilled her, but because work alone could help her to forget. "Try
to forget" were the last words which she heard Peter speak, there
in the woods beside the turbulent mountain stream when she had
thought him a spy, a vile and venal wretch, and he had not said one
word to exculpate himself. How could he when this might have meant
rousing her suspicions of Jasper?—or perhaps it was just
pride that had caused him to hold his tongue. Pride, which so often
has proved love's most persistent enemy.</p>

<p>Or perhaps he no longer cared, and that was why he thought it
would be so easy for her to forget.</p>

<p>Since then nearly two years! Rosemary walking through the park
that late afternoon in July. She had been to the Albert Hall to
hear Kreisler, and she wandered up the Broad Walk under the trees,
because she did not feel that she could stand the noise and bustle
of streets at a moment when her whole soul was still full of the
exquisite music conjured up by that great magician. It was very hot
and she was rather tired, so she sat down on a chair in the shade.
Then suddenly she saw Peter. He was coming towards her, quite
naturally, as if to an assignation. He looked just the same as he
always did—like a boy, clean and straight-limbed as a young
god, his eyes shining with excitement, that quaint,
self-deprecating smile on his lips that Rosemary knew so well.</p>

<p>"I've been to hear old Kreisler," were the first words he said.
"Wasn't he wonderful?"</p>

<p>So like Peter! He dragged a chair quite close to hers and sat
down. He threw down his hat and passed his hand through his hair.
He did not attempt to greet her in any way. "I've been to hear old
Kreisler!" So like Peter! The very first words...and she hadn't
seen him for nearly two years.</p>

<p>After a second or two he went on: "I wouldn't speak to you in
the Albert Hall. When you went out I followed you. I knew you would
wander out here."</p>

<p>And Rosemary asked quite casually: "Have you been in England
long?"</p>

<p>"Only a few hours," Peter replied with a laugh. "I crossed over
by the night boat, via Havre. I always meant to sample that
journey, and it was really rather nice." After that he was silent
for a moment; then suddenly he seized her hand. She had no gloves
on, and he held the soft palm to his lips. Rosemary did not move.
She was not looking at Peter; she was just watching a huge
blackbird that had landed on the elm tree opposite and who was
whistling away for dear life.</p>

<p>"Rosemary, when can we be married?" Peter asked abruptly.</p>

<p>She couldn't help smiling. It, too, was so like Peter. "I've
waited two years, dash it all," he went on. "Two years in hell. Now
I'm not going to wait any longer. When can we be married,
Rosemary?"</p>

<p>Then Rosemary ceased to watch the blackbird and turned slowly to
look at Peter.</p>

<p>"Whenever you like, dear," she replied.</p>
